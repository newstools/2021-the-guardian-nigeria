We are going to take until the last minute to make the decision,” Martinez said. “We’ll see tomorrow if they will be involved or not. “Tomorrow, it will be a medical decision in the afternoon and then we’ll make a football decision after that,” he added. Captain Hazard and midfielder De Bruyne both hobbled off during Belgium’s 1-0 last-16 win over Portugal last weekend. The Red Devils are bidding to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1980 when they lost to West Germany in the final.
