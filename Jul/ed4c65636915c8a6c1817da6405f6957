Construction at Ikeja GRA Lagos State Government, yesterday, promised to address flooding and other environmental challenges leading to the collapse of road networks within the Ikeja Government Reserved Area (GRA) with ongoing urban regeneration project. Special Adviser on Works and Infrastructure, Aramide Adeyoye, an engineer, disclosed this during an inspection of works on a network of four roads, comprising Oduduwa Way, Oduduwa Crescent, Oba Dosunmu and Sobo Arobiodu streets.
She stressed that the area used to be exclusively residential and one of the cleanest and most orderly neighbourhoods in Lagos, but the  growth of many commercial concerns had turned Ikeja GRA into a commercial centre. According to her,  the phenomenal increase in activities within Ikeja GRA over the time has led to various environmental and infrastructural challenges, including flooding that threatens the multi-billion-naira prime properties in the GRA, as many of the streets lack proper drainages and water channels, thereby impeding the flow of traffic, extending travel hours, causing damages to vehicles and low patronage for businesses. Adeyoye, who said the ministry was working in conjunction with the Office of Drainage Services to address the flooding and infrastructural challenges, added that upon completion of the ongoing regeneration works and upgrading of roads in Ikeja GRA, there would be improved drainage network to address the problem of perennial flooding and provide good connectivity with other roads in the vicinity. On the completion of the  project, the special adviser said Oduduwa Way was at 80 per cent completion stage and would be completed by the end of August, while Oduduwa Crescent, Oba Dosumu and Sobo Arobiodu Streets are to be completed in December 2021. Adeyoye urged residents to take ownership of the projects and guide them jealously against misuse and abuse that could compromise the integrity of the pavement and overall riding surface.
