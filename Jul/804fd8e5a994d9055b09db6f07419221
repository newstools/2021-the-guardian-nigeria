Law & Order Actor, Isaiah Stokes Indicted For Murder TV actor Isaiah Stokes, who has made appearances on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” “Power,” and “Blue Bloods,” has been charged with murder for the February shooting of a New York man. Stokes, 41, was charged with second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree criminal weapon possession in a Queens courtroom Friday after being arraigned by a grand jury. Queen District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a press release: The defendant is accused of unloading nearly eleven shots during this brazen afternoon shooting. Gun violence is all too prevalent in our neighborhoods. We will not allow it to become the norm. Prosecutors contend that on Feb. 7, video surveillance footage showed Stokes exiting a car and approaching the driver’s side window of a parked white Jeep Grand Cherokee. Stokes allegedly fired eleven gunshots into the car hitting Tyrone Jones, 37, who died of his injuries. Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Holder set Stokes’ return date to court for July 19. If convicted, Stokes faces up to 25 years to life in prison. Representatives for Stokes did not reply to a request for comment. A police source told New York Daily News that Stokes and Jones had gotten into a fight four months before the shooting at Jones’ birthday party in a nightclub in Long Island City in October. The fight broke out when Stokes allegedly hit on Jones’ girlfriend, the source said. Four months later, police said Jones was waiting to meet a woman in the rented Jeep around a mile from his home when he was ambushed by a gunman. Jones was shot almost a dozen times and police recovered 10 shell casings from a 9mm weapon at the scene. Since the mid-2000s, Isaiah has been featured on many popular television shows such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Boardwalk Empire, Blue Bloods, The Americans, and several others. He was most recently seen on the hit drama series Power in 2019.
