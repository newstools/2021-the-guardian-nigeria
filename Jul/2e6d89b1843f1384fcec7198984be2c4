 Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company  A group, the All Electricity Consumers Protection Forum (AECPF), filed the suit dated July 12, before an Ikeja High Court. A copy of the suit was obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos. The originating summons filed by the groupâ€™s lawyer, Mr Olalekan Matti is supported by a 25-paragraph affidavit deposed to by its National Secretary, Mrs Kehinde Akinloye-Jones. The claimant alleged that the defendants had failed to comply with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Order on capping of unmetered Residential 2 and Commercial 1 electricity customers. The group claimed both DisCos failed to comply with the capping Order NO/NERC/197/2020 for a period of 10 months from February 2020 to November 2020 to the consumers affected by the capping Order. The claimant asked the court to determine whether it was within the power of DisCos to disobey the directives of NERC pursuant to section 63(1) of Electric Power Section reform Act 2005. They, therefore asked the court for a declaration that the act of the first and second defendants violation of the capping method was unlawful. The group also asked the court for an order directing the defendants to refund the consumers affected by unlawful billing for the period of 10 months under a repealed estimation billing instead of capping. The claimant further asked the court to direct the defendants to pay the sum of N500, 000 for the cost of the suit. NAN reports that the suit is yet to be assigned to any judge and no date has been fixed for hearing.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
