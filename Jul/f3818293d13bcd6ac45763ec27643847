The Lagos State Police Command has arraigned the 47 Yoruba Nation agitators, arrested last Saturday before a magistrates’ court in Yaba, Lagos.
 
They were arraigned for allegedly going against the law enforcement agency’s orders and caused public disturbances across the state.
 
It was learnt that the police had also sought an ex parte order to detain the demonstrators for another 21 days. Spokesman for the Lagos Police Command, Olumuyiwa Adejobi , could not be reached for response on the arraignment as calls and messages sent to his phone were not returned.  Others were Tajudeen Bakare, Abiodun Adenuga, Azeez Adetayo, Rasheed Shittu, Quadri Ishola, Oluwasegun Arire, Kunle Aremo, Olamilekan Lolade, Tunde Lawal, Musbau Rasaq, and Bamidele Akomolafe.
 
At the parade, the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said that suspects were arrested for violating the ban that no rally or gathering should be held in any part of the state. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
