Several villagers in the Dabna community in Hong local government in Adamawa State were murdered, many ruthlessly wounded during an early hour raid by the outlawed Boko Haram insurgents. Our correspondent also learnt that scores have fled their ancestral homes for safety. An eyewitness told The Guardian Newspaper that the outlaws bombarded the community at the wee hours of Wednesday. Another fleeing villager, who pleaded anonymity, recounted that the attackers were, “heavily armed.” According to him, “They killed many of our people, even many of us who were lucky sustained severe injuries.” He recalled that “one of the community’s villain warriors was among those killed.” He said half of the community has run away to neighbouring villages for fear of further attack. Meanwhile, our sources hinted that the people in Garka, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha’s community, is also not safe and that, “about 18 persons were discovered dead by Nigerian Military in the bush.” All efforts to reach the 23 Armour Brigade Public Relations Officer (PRO,) Major Sani Mohammed for confirmation proved abortive as calls put to him were not answered.
