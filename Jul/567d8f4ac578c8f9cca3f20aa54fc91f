Director-General of the National Council of Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, is set to break new grounds with the release of a book on the history of golf in the country. The 210-page book, which is expected to be released to the Nigerian public on October 1, the nation’s Independence day, dwells extensively on the nation’s golf sojourn for over 150 years, especially from years white rubber merchants started the game in Sapele, Delta State, through the years white tin miners in Jos, Plateau State, further exposed the game to Nigerians. Clearly motivated by his experience in several trips to world’s ‘golf shrines’ like the Ancient and Modern St. Andrews, the world’s golf headquarters and the Professional Golf Association [PGA] of America, Runsewe, who is a patron of Nigeria’s most exotic golf club, The Golf Garden Waterfront [GGWF] in Wuse, Abuja, paints clear pictures of how the game of golf has evolved in Nigeria and individuals, who ensured the sport transmitted from the white settlers to many Nigerians. The book also explains why cultural golf attires were introduced to millions of Nigerians and prominent citizens like Oba Ewuare 11 of Benin and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, who already adorn the attires. “We have a long and rich history of golfing in Nigeria,” Runsewe said. “Ï hold this belief that if we cannot write our own golf history, nobody will do it for us. This is why I embarked on this project and I must tell everyone it was such a thrilling experience.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
