“Upbringing could pose as a hindrance to survival.” This thought sounded absurd to me at first, but further upon review, I have observed how decisions based on convictions and values, for example, morals, could be a reason for apparent hardship. This was my reality as life recently threw me curveball, and the project manager in me did a postmortem on why this could be. It was during this period that I also had a conversation with a good friend who alluded that it is possible that a good upbringing could be a disadvantage to survival. Hence, some questions I sought answers to in this regard became: I understand an algorithm to be a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or set of operations for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. Is there a guide that we program with our inputs? Does my decision to say no to an immoral situation, preclude me from future opportunities, in an immoral world? Of course, my decision is borne out of my convictions which have been largely formed from inputs from the sum of my life’s experiences. Hence my “choice tastebuds” have been programmed to churn out responses and preferences in various
situations. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1475451 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SayNO-scaled-e1626345281579-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> I have been told severally that Korean shows are the rave, and I have decided not to try them out, as I believe this will distort my content algorithm. The type of shows presented may be misaligned with my actual taste. Therefore, I diligently guard my Netflix account, since I do not know how long I could get away without character content consumption. The effect would be an algorithmic adjustment resulting from consistent inputs of new content selection over a period. My Netflix account would no longer resemble my preferred, or should I say former taste of content. It would seem like a new account. Is this the same with life? Is there such a thing as
spiritual algorithm? Can this be explained using the bible verse, “things that are seen are made
of that which is unseen”? Can we imagine our life decisions and what we input into ourselves becoming the basis for the set of rules that program our life, including things we have not seen or heard? When we think of this, we can see how this might be the case. We have all heard statements like, “Oh no! don’t take that to him o, he is too honest” or “No she is a prude”. The characterisations of you living your morality can be colourful, but also does it serve to derail your participation in the economy, does it prevent you from creating value.
