The electoral umpire, in a report by its Election and Party Monitoring (EPM) Department, testified that contrary to the results announced by the Governor Dapo Abiodun-led Anambra Governorship Election Committee, no primary held in the state on Saturday, June 26.
 
In the document, signed by Ibe U. Ibe (Head); Nkechi Abuh, (Assistant Director) and Modibo Bellel (Principal Executive Officer), the EPM stated that the purported primary, which produced Senator Andy Uba as its winner, was non-existent.  Uba had reportedly scored 230,201 out of 348,490 accredited voters. One of the aggrieved contestants, Moghalu, had told reporters in Abuja last Tuesday that he would “do everything within my ability and the law to ensure that the travesty orchestrated by Prince Dapo Abiodun and his team did not stand.”
 
He said he expected the APC national leadership and “all those in our party, who still believe in the promise of democracy, good governance and committed to protecting respect for electoral processes and the rule of law to act now, by ensuring that a properly conducted primary was held.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
