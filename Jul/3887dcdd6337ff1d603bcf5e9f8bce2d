Nigerian flag carrier, Air Peace, has set July 23 date for the resumption of flight operations into Banjul in Gambia and Dakar in Senegal. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, yesterday said the operation will provide more options for regional connectivity, beginning with three weekly flights. Olisa said the Dakar and Banjul routes will be operated with the ultramodern Embraer 195-E2 aircraft, “and we shall resume more routes and increase frequencies to other destinations as we take delivery of more brand new E195-E2s as well as other aircraft undergoing maintenance abroad.” Air Peace suspended its regional routes following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the lockdown that ensued last year. But the airline is now resuming these routes, the first being Accra, which was restored in March, 2021. Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, earlier said that the West Coast operation is among the 26 destinations expected to begin soon. He said: “We are still processing documents for the London route. Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) will help us push further. We have also applied for China and India too. We have already had seven flights to China and 22 to India already. All of these are markets waiting for Air Peace,” Onyema said. Air Peace currently services 17 domestic routes, five regional routes and two international destinations, including Johannesburg, while it boasts of a mixed fleet of 28 aircraft, the latest being three brand new 124-seat capacity E195-E2 jets.
