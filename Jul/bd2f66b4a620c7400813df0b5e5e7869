PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment and reassignment of chancellors to 42 federal universities.  All appointees are monarchs. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, who disclosed this at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said the exercise was also to replace deceased occupants in a bid for them to cement relationships between communities in the country. He said: “As royal fathers, these chancellors are expected to be the moral compass of the various universities to which they are assigned. “Let me reiterate that the chancellors shall be presented to the university community at an investiture to be organised by the university for the purpose, or during the next convocation when the exercise would precede conferment of degrees.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
