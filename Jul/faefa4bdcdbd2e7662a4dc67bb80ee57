Photo/FACEBOOK/ godwinobasekiofficial  Edo State Government has restated that ongoing reforms in the state’s public and civil service are part of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s efforts to retool workers with the right skills to meet the demands of modern and improved efficiency and productivity.  IN another development, Obaseki said his administration would continue to prioritise investment in youth development and implement policies that would enable them to acquire a new skill-set to contribute their quota in the post- COVID-19 global economic recovery.
 
He made the remarks during commemoration of the World Youth Skills Day, marked on July 15 every year by the United Nations and its agencies.
 
“As part of our broad strategy for post-COVID-19 economic recovery, we will continue to equip our youths with new skills-set to boost their employability through the EdoJobs and in line with our vision for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET),” he said.
