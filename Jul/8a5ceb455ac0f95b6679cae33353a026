Speaking during the training of agro promoters on the operations of its Farm & Fortune hub model, the Country Manager, OCP Africa Fertilisers Nigeria, Mr Caleb Usoh, said it was a milestone in the company’s effort to contribute to productivity and food security across the country. Usoh said the Farm & Fortune hubs were set up to cater for the needs by providing effective service-delivery, in accordance with its policy of proximity. He explained that they were designed to offer knowledge to increase in crop yield and productivity that would lead to improved food security and increased income for smallholder farmers.

Accredited agents, according to him, will provide smallholder farmers with timely and relevant quality farm inputs at affordable prices.He added that farmers benefit from regular access to high-quality services and goods, which are specifically marketed for smallholders, while the agro entrepreneurs will be exposed to business training to grow customers base. The model, he emphasised, is sustainable and scalable, and, in the long-term, would help the promoters achieve financial independence. He urged operators in agriculture to avail themselves of the hub, including technical and financial assistance, to undertake more agricultural activities, while encouraging them to consider new farming techniques and new varieties of crops.
