•Country ranks 47th on global index
•ITU wants govts to block $6tr estimated loss to cybercrime in 2021 Nigeria has ranked 47th on the global cybersecurity index (GCI) 2020. This is even as the global telecoms body ranked Mauritius, Tanzania and Ghana respectively, ahead of Nigeria, in countries in Africa, tackling cybercrimes headlong.
  
The index examined the readiness of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) member countries in curbing the rising cybercrime.
   
The GCI, which ranked 182 countries, is ITU’s document that monitors countries’ growing commitment around the world in tackling and reducing cybersecurity threats.
    
GCI 2020, the index’s fourth iteration, measures the cybersecurity commitments of 193 ITU member states and the State of Palestine. It aimed to identify gaps, serve as a roadmap to guide national strategies, inform legal frameworks, build capacity, highlight good practices, strengthen international standards and foster a culture of cybersecurity.  “I invite all ITU Member States to continue updating us on their progress on cybersecurity-related commitments so that we can effectively share experiences, research, and solutions to create a trusted cyberspace for all,” Bogdan-Martin stated.
    
Measuring the evolving cybersecurity landscape, ITU said about one billion people worldwide became Internet users for the first time between 2015 (when the first GCI was released) and 2019. With global losses due to cybercrime expected to reach $6 trillion this year, according to third-party data, citizens count on governments to enhance cybersecurity norms and protect increasingly exposed personal and financial data.
    
ITU has produced four GCI editions to date, providing periodic global snapshots of a rapidly evolving industry. With each iteration, the methodology has been adapted to shed more light on countries’ cybersecurity commitments.
   
According to the body, each country’s level of development or engagement is assessed based on five pillars of the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda – legal measures, technical measures, organizational measures, capacity development and cooperation.
