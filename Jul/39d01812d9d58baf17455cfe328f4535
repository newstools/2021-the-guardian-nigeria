Rapper Londre Sylvester Dies After Being Shot 64 Times In Chicago A Chicago rapper died after suffering as many as 64 bullet wounds to his head and other parts of his body in what police are calling an ambush shooting just as he was released from jail. Londre Sylvester, 31, who is known by his stage name KTS Dre, was one of three people who were shot just outside Cook County Jail in the Little Village section of Chicago on Saturday according to a report by Daily Mail. The shooting took place as Sylvester was released from jail while wearing a monitoring device on his ankle. Witnesses reported that two armed men stepped outside a vehicle and started shooting Sylvester, striking him in the face and chest. Investigators found at least 59 shell casings on the 2700 block of West 27th Street, which is across the street from the jail. Sylvester was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just before 9:30pm on Saturday. His next of kin was notified on Sunday. A 60-year-old woman who was reportedly with him at the time of the shooting suffered a wound to the knee. She was listed in good condition at Stroger Hospital, according to police. Another woman, 30, had a bullet graze the side of her face. She is said to be in good condition. No arrests have been made as of late Sunday. Sylvester had been jailed for violation of bail bond for violating the conditions of his release in a 2020 felony gun case. He was fitted for electronic monitoring before walking free on Saturday. The shooting comes as Chicago continues to grapple with a surge in violent crime over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. Statistics from the police department showed that at least 108 people were shot, 17 fatally, between July 2nd and July 4th. Eleven children, some as young as five and six, were wounded in what was the most violent weekend of the year. Two police were among the cityâ€™s shooting victims.
