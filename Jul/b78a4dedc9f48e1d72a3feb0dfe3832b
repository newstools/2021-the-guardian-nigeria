But itâ€™s his swagger, the full essence that is the African superstar and recent Grammy winner, Burna Boy that made us stay. Gyrating on stage to the sound of his Afrobeats music, in his chunky boots and unbuttoned shirts, hanging loosely off his shoulders as the crowd go crazy, reminiscing gbana filled nights, Burna Boy is Burna Boy.

While we might not be able to do much to help in the aura department, we can do something for the look. Some of the fashion paraphernalia of the African giant are Statement sunglasses, Derby shoes, Dramatic coats, Tops and bottoms matching sets and Double-breasted suits.
