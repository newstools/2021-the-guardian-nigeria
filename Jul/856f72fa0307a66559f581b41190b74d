Commissioner for Establishments, Training, and Pensions, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle The Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC) has urged retiring employees in the state’s civil service to begin documentation six months before their retirement date. The commission made this known at the 20th pre-retirement documentation seminar held virtually to enlighten potential retirees on the gains of early and proper documentation and matters bothering health care and financial prudence after retirement. The Commissioner, Establishments, Training, and Pensions, Ajibola Ponnle, represented by Permanent Secretary Civil Service Pension Office, Oluwole Onasanya, commended LASPEC for its consistency in ensuring that retirees are paid and properly attended to when it comes to preparation and presentation on retirees’ bond certificates. Ponnle stressed that the Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration was centered on ensuring that retirees are paid as at when due while striking to ensure that all pending payments are offset to facilitate the pay-as-you-go model of payment for retirees. The Director-General of LASPEC, Babalola Obilana, who also spoke at the event, explained the purpose of the seminar was to guide staff of the state civil service to guarantee a smooth exit from active service. He said: “Having spent a significant amount of productive years working for the state government, transition to retirement must be stress-free.” He noted that the state government was passionate about the welfare of its workforce, adding that the present administration was on its toes on certifying the speedy resolution of all pension matters.
