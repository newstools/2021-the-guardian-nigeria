He sat out the tournament hosts’ 1-0 semi-final win over Peru on Monday but is now set to also miss the final against either Argentina or Colombia in the final at Rio de Janeiro’s iconic Maracana stadium. He was also fined $5,000, CONMEBOL said. Jesus, 24, was shown a red card on 48 minutes, just two minutes after Lucas Paqueta gave the Selecao the lead against Chile. Paqueta was also the match-winner against Peru, where Everton took Jesus’s place.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
