The Oyo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality, yesterday, held its final sitting on petitions of police brutality and related extra-judicial killings. At its final sitting held at House of Chiefs, State Secretariat, Ibadan, Chairman of the panel, Justice Badejoko Adeniji (rtd) said that the panel attended to 163 petitions. This came to an end eight months after its inauguration by Governor Seyi Makinde. Adeniji stated that the panel received and investigated petitions on police-related abuses, evaluated evidences presented by petitioners, looked at their surrounding circumstances and validity of complaints. Adeniji said the panelâ€™s recommendations of compensation, remedial measures and restitution for victims and petitioners would be handed over to the state government in due course. Mrs. Oseni Fatiat, in a petition against Inspector Clement Olarenwaju and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), demanded N10 million as compensation for being brutalised by policemen. Oseni recounted that police on June 28, 2018 stormed her residence alleging that a vehicle parked in front of her house was stolen. Oseni said that she was whisked away and kept in police custody both at Dugbe, Ibadan and Ikeja, Lagos, for 15 days, where she was hit by the butt of the gun on her knee and chest to confess for an allegation of robbery she knew nothing about. With the police not present at the panel sitting to put up their defence, the Adeniji-led panel said it would forward its recommendation for remedial measures to the state government for consideration.
