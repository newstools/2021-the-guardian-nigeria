The Tomi Arayomi-led ministry recently opened its Lagos center under its RIG Africa division, with an inaugural service at Grace Gardens in Lekki Phase 1. The event, which hosted dignitaries from different walks of life, was spice with musical performances by the in-house band. RIG, which stands for Restoring Issacharâ€™s Generation, is an apostolic and prophetic movement with established branches in Asia, United Kingdom and the United States, which is bringing the authenticity and integrity of the prophetic and its power to this generation. RIG is doing this through a revival and a reawakening of the true sons of God to the prophetic and apostolic mandate given by God. The launch was attended by teachers of faith from different assemblies, including Pastor Moses Ida-Michaels of Ecclesia Hills, Pastor Debola Deji-Kurunmi of the Kingdom Women Global Alliance, Pastor Bolaji Idowu of Harvesters International Christian Center, Pastor Udobong Ntia of the Kingdom Community fellowship, Pastor Isi Iginegba of the People of Influence and many others. Also in attendance was wife of the Olu of Warri designate and president of RIG Africa, Mrs Ivie Emiko. Prophet Tomi Arayomi, along with his wife, welcomed guests to the launch and announced before the main service started that he and his wife were going to make Lagos their new home. They encouraged everyone to keep praying for Nigeria, emphasizing that God had a special interest in the nation. Meanwhile, the next RIG Lagos gathering holds tomorrow, by 5pm, at The Grace Gardens, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos.
