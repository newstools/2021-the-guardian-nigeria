George Akume, absolving Fulani herdsmen of guilt in killings of farmers in Benue State, as disgraceful. The Publicity Secretary, Bemgba Iortyom, said yesterday that the minister had, at the event in Wannune, Tarka Local Council, described those in support of the ban on open grazing as “out of their minds.” Iortyom stated: “The minister, in a recorded video yesterday during a wedding at NKST Central Church, Wannune, Tarka Local Council, categorically condemned the promulgation of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, labelling it an agenda to chase Fulani people away from the state. He added that when he was governor, he did not enact anti-open grazing law but Benue was very peaceful and Fulani people did not kill anyone. Akume also said as long as the law remains in force, herdsmen would continue to kill Benue people.” But, the State Caretaker Publicity Secretary of APC, James Ornguga, lambasted the PDP for trying to reintroduce its pre-2019 dummy to foist unfounded allegations on the minister over matters relating to herdsmen attacks to cause disaffection. He said that Benue PDP was only seeking disaffection due to the depletion in its ranks “The PDP’s statement is petty, frivolous and even defamatory against Akume and APC, in the hope of whipping up dangerous sentiments that would arouse public anger against our party,” the APC chief added.
