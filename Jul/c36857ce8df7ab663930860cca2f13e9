Imo State House of Assembly has sacked the Chief Whip, Arthur Egwim (Ideato North), and replaced him with Obinna Okwara (Nkwerre), as it dissolved all its standing committees. It also suspended six members “for conducting themselves in unparliamentary manner.” The suspended lawmakers are Kennedy Ibe (Obowo), Crown Onyemaechi (Ihitte-Uboma), Uche Ogbuagu (Ikeduru), Dominic Ezerioha (Oru West), Philip Ejiogu (Owerri North) and Anyadike Nwosu (Ezinihitte Mbaise). Ejiogu and Nwosu are of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), while the other four are of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Announcing the development on the floor of the House yesterday, the Speaker, Paul Emeziem, added that the suspension was to enable the House enjoy relative peace and smooth operation. Emeziem, who said the decision was reached at the executive session of the House, added that his leadership would not condone acts capable of bringing the House to disrepute and ridicule. His words: “We have observed that some members here have been conducting themselves in an unparliamentary manner, thereby bringing the house to ridicule. We have thoroughly examined this issue at the executive session and have resolved that peace and order must continue to reign. “The executive session has, therefore, recommended the suspension of the members that have engaged in different acts of misconduct. This action is to ensure that the image of the House remains intact, while providing a functional environment and the synergy required to ensure that all arms of government work together.” Meanwhile, there was uproar in the House, as the members were divided on the development. There was heavy gunshot by the security personnel within the Assembly complex in an attempt to restore normalcy, following attempts to attack the Speaker, who, along with his deputy, Amara Iwuanyanwu, were later smuggled out of the complex by their security aides. Some of the suspended lawmakers told newsmen after plenary that the suspension did not follow due process, describing it as illegal and undemocratic. They, however, said they would challenge their suspension in the court of law.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
