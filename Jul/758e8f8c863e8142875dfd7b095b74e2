Dear Kabiyesi, I bring you warm greetings from the street. May your reign be long and your tenure most rewarding. I do not belong to the class of those that wish you more children given the battalion you already have from multiple Olori. But may you live long enough to train them successfully, and accomplish enough for the envy of your ancestors. Ase.
  
Kabiyesi, I was particularly worried by your recent endorsement of the proposed creation of a fourth-tier of government for traditional rulers, and that warrants my letter to you. Please, forgive my audacity to address the subject. As a son of the soil, I know that a kolanut matures only in the mouth of an elder. However, without the youth having a bite of the proverbial kolanut, the elder cannot be enthroned. The elder is just as important to nation building as the youth, so you can forgive my flippancy, Kabiyesi. I made efforts to deliver this message in person, but your overzealous guards denied access to the palace, like they have always done to matters of urgent public importance.
  
I reckon that the subject-matter has been long in coming and its justification is not far-fetched. Indeed, your forefathers were the early set of ‘politicians’ that held the rein of affairs before the coming of colonial interlopers. When the jegudu-jera oyinbo people were dislodged at independence, it was anticipated that Awolowo, Azikiwe, Balewa and co. would return to the old political structure of having traditional rulers at the helm of affairs. Sadly, they did not and the stool has since remained an appendage. Things further went south for traditional stools at the 1976 Constitutional reform where Royal Fathers were subsumed under the new Local Government Authority.
