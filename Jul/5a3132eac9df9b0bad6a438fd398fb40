Chidinma said after they lodged in the short-let apartment she stepped out to withdraw to get food and came back to meet the deceased in the pool of his blood. “I went to withdraw money from the ATM and when I was leaving, he locked the door after me,” Ojukwu said in an interview with Crime Fighters. “When I came back, I noticed that the door wasn’t locked and the duvet was on the floor. “The couch was facing the door and the bed was stained with blood already. “The floor was bloody and the TV was on.” Ojukwu said the room was disarranged as if someone broke into it and she was afraid that if she raised an alarm, the police would arrest her for the crime. “I packed my things and left the room,” Ojukwu said “I took the bag that contained his ID card and bank statements. The 21-year-old said she took the phone and later withdrew more money from his atm which he had earlier promised to give her “There was no 5 million naira in my account,” Ojukwu said. “I don’t have anything to do with his death. “I know someone did it, but I don’t know who the person is. “I don’t know what happened when I went to buy the food. “I did not kill him. “I believe someone knew where we were and waited for me to leave to do what they did. She said she decided to take the blame initially because she was scared and insisted no one is influencing her. Ojukwu’s new narration contradicts her previous confessions in the past interviews. She had told newsmen in Lagos that she stabbed Ataga to death in self-defence. “Monday, June 14, we were together drinking, smoking and I also went to get food. On Tuesday, June 15, he was making advances at me and I resisted, so he became violent and later had his way,” Ojukwu said in an earlier interview. “In the afternoon he ordered for smoke, ate and we became high because I also smoked with him even though I was still angry for the first one he did. “So, I was on my own, watching a movie on the couch. He came at me again and I said no because I wasn’t happy with him. “I told him that he doesn’t help me but only plays me around, he kept trying to make advances and I was resisting so I had to defend myself. “At some point, he hit my head on the wall and was choking me. I tried escaping but the door was locked so he pulled me back. “I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed him twice in the neck and threw the knife on the bed. “He then tried reaching for the knife so I picked it again and stabbed him the third time,” she said.
