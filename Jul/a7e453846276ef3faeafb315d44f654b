The Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) said it has identified and marked 70 noticeably dilapidated and highly distressed buildings within the state, which would be removed to further prevent building collapse that could lead to loss of lives and property. Speaking during the demolition of a partially-collapsed structure at No. 19, Church Street, Lagos Island, the General Manager of the agency, Gbolahan Oki, said 20 distressed structures were discovered in Lagos Island alone but added that removal of the identified structures would follow due processes, which would include conducting a Non Destructive Test (NDT) to verify if they were fit for human habitation or needed to have some renovation works on them. Oki further reiterated that “the government has absolute zero tolerance for building collapse,” hence,  all building codes and regulations within the state would be strictly enforced, including the need for all buildings above two floors to obtain insurance, as contained in the Building Regulations 2019 (as amended). He warned building developers and owners to always involve LASBCA in their construction project, by seeking authorisation to commence building, after obtaining all necessary permits. They should also invite LASBCA at every stage and finally, should obtain Certificates of Completion and fit for habitation, once the construction is fully completed. Oki appealed to residents to assist the government in actualising its objective of creating a safer Lagos, by reporting noticed substandard building constructions and dilapidated structures within their locality to the agency for necessary actions. On the demolition of the partially-collapsed building, Oki said it had become necessary to immediately remove them, as they were dilapidated, distressed and not fit for human habitation. He emphasised that there were over 50 buildings marked for demolition in Lagos, adding that the motive “is to sanitise and rid Lagos of distressed and dilapidated buildings to stem the era of building collapse in the state.” Meanwhile, Oki and other officials had earlier visited the scene to get an on- the-spot assessment and asked residents to evacuate and relocate for their own safety.
