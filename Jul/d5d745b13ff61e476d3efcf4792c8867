Ataga The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, on Wednesday, said more suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing of the chief executive officer of Super TV Usifo Ataga. Odumosu, during a parade of suspects at the police command in Ikeja, said the police have established a case of conspiracy and murder and more suspects have been arrested. The commissioner did not disclose who the suspects are or how many of them have been arrested. He said the investigation is ongoing in the matter. 21-year- old Chidinma Ojukwu had been arrested in connection to the murder of Ataga. Ojukwu told newsmen in Lagos that she stabbed Ataga to death in self-defence. “Monday, June 14, we were together drinking, smoking and I also went to get food. On Tuesday, June 15, he was making advances at me and I resisted, so he became violent and later had his way,” Ojukwu said in an earlier interview. But in a recent interview with CrimeTV, Ojukwu, denied killing the SuperTV boss. She said she decided to take the blame initially because she was scared and insisted no one is influencing her. Ojukwu said after they lodged in the short-let apartment she stepped out to withdraw to get food and came back to meet the deceased in the pool of his blood.
