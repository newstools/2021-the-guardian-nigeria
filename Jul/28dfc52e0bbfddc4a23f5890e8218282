Ohanaeze Ndigbo faction, yesterday, faulted the claim by Arewa Youths that power rotation is unconstitutional, insisting that an Igbo President in the 2023 general election will end insurgency in the north and put the country on track. In a statement in Abakaliki, the Secretary General of the Chidi Ibeh faction of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said Arewa Youths do not seem to have a clear picture of the dwindling fortunes of the North. The statement reads: “We understand why Northern Elders’ Forum and Arewa Consultative Forum focus on getting assurances from the South of what the North stands to gain if they are allowed to succeed Buhari in 2023. “It’s obvious that the government’s incapacity to get lasting remedies for the insurgency and banditry is giving Northern leadership sleepless nights. But with Igbo investments worth N22 trillion and out-of-school Northern children rising to 19 million from the 19 Northern states, only a disciplined personality with Igbo entrepreneurial bravery and heroism can restore normalcy in the North. “Igbo Presidency 2023 will undoubtedly restore Nigeria to the path of greatness and economic prosperity as Igbo men and women of proven integrity and willpower are in abundance to give Nigerians the much desired good governance anchored in economic advancement.” The statement adds: “Arewa Youths do not seem to have a clearer picture of the dwindling fortunes of the North, with news of Borno State having two governors, one led by (APC controlling 25 LGAs) and ISWAP controlling five LGAs). There are fears of ISWAP taking over the entire North and Arewa Youths’ assertion of the North succeeding President Buhari will strengthen insecurity in the North. “It’s an obnoxious perspective for Arewa Youths to allow themselves to be misled by myopic political leaders, that have exhausted the chances of getting Northern territories out of the insurgency of the last 10 years.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
