Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs (LASODA) has sensitised parents and guardians of children with special needs on care for the children. The office said caregivers should be patient with them because of their peculiar conditions. General Manager of LASODA, Oluwadamilare Ogundairo, spoke in Lagos at an event entitled ‘Strengthening the Parents of Children with Special Needs to Care Better.’ According to him, caregivers should not lose hope in the children, but need to spend that extra time and attention on them to realise their goals. He said: “I wish to appreciate the presence of everyone here and of our children with special needs, on whose account we are all gathered today.” In his keynote address, Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, said the sensitisation was germane because children with disabilities depend on caregivers and the immediate environment to thrive. He stressed that parents, guardians, caregivers, as well as their immediate environment largely determine the physical and psychosocial development of children with disabilities. According to him, people closest to these children are usually faced with a lot of challenges in raising them physically and mentally.
