According to the organisers of the championship, the state karatekas’ not-too-impressive performance at the last National Sports Festival held in Benin City, Edo State, necessitated the screening exercise. Athletes from different clubs across state took part in the one-day trial, which at the end of the day produced young talented karatekas, who are expected to give their best when called upon for duty. The athletes, who displayed their skills in kata and pumse, in both the male and female categories, commended the association for the programme, adding that a lot needs to be done to expose them to international championships. Chairman LSKA, Omololu Bello, said the trials is one of the many programmes lined up to unearth athletes and also to help them hone their skills for a better performance, as a they move on in their sporting career. “We are using the trials to select quality talents for the state ahead of the National Sports Festival in Delta State, next year. This is just one of the programmes we have lined up to discover, train and nurture the karatekas to become worthy ambassadors for the state. The athletes, discovered, will also go for a competition in Benin Republic soon, as part of measures to expose them to the modern techniques in the sport,” he stated.
