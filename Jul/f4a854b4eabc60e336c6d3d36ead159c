Irina Shayk Reportedly Confirms She And Kanye West Are Just Friends The news of Irina Shayk and Kanye West made rounds on social media. This comes after the news of the divorce between Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. However, according to new reports, sources close to Irina now say that she and Kanye are “just friends” and are not in any romantic relationship. In an exclusive report by PageSix, all those who were hoping that Kanye West and Irina Shayk would be the new “It” couple in Hollywood will have to take a permanent step back, as it appears that the two are on a platonic-only level. Sources close to the model reportedly confirmed that while she has known and worked with Kanye for several years, they are nothing more than friends, and she “doesn’t want a relationship with him.” Additionally, it was also stated that Irina “doesn’t want to be linked with anyone right now. She is happy being single.” Just last week during Kanye’s recent trip to Paris, Irina reportedly turned down his invitation to join him and sit front row at the Balenciaga runway show because “she doesn’t want the association that they are dating, which is what would have run in the press if she showed up [in Paris with him.] It would have been another month of news saying that they are dating,” the source stated. As for the photos of them during Kanye’s birthday celebration in France back in June, the source doubled down and explained that although Irina attended, there were around 50 other people there, so it was definitely not romantic. For a brief update on the pair’s decade-long history, Irina Shayk initially worked with Kanye West as a model for his music video for ‘Power’ back in 2010, which led to her modeling for his billion-dollar Yeezy brand multiple times as reported by TSR. Irina was last spotted publicly with actor Bradley Cooper, the father of her 4-year-old daughter.
