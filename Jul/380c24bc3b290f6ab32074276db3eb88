There was palpable tension in Asaba, Delta State, as boys suspected to be cultists went berserk, killing no fewer than five persons within two days.
 
The Guardian gathered that the suspected cultists were members of Vikings and Black Axe, who were on a revenge mission following the killing of their 51-year-old Searchmore Ochei, the state ex-NULGE chairman.
   
It was learnt that a 60-year old “suspected veteran cultist,” Ifeanyi Nwokobia, a surveyor, was reportedly killed in a reprisal, behind the Healthcare Centre, opposite Studio 24, near Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba.
 
The cultists, also on Tuesday, allegedly killed a boy suspected to be a cultist, severed his head and hung the head on top of a fence close to Oshimili South Council, where people gathered to take a glimpse of the ugly incident.  Meanwhile, gunmen have reportedly killed Stephen Odje, a bio-chemistry student of Delta State University (DELSU) and abducted two others.
 
Those abducted included a geology student, Divine Omajuwa and his colleague, Husseina Hamza, of the pharmacology department.
   
Sources told The Guardian that Steve Odje died on the spot along the Oria axis of the Abraka Road, Ethiope East council, where the incident happened.
 
It was learnt that the victims were coming to Warri from school in Abraka, when the hoodlums attacked them.
 
Some students who spoke with The Guardian appealed to the state government and security agencies to rescue the abducted students before any harm befalls them.
 
Delta State Police Spokesman, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident, saying the police were after the  hoodlums with a view to arrest them.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
