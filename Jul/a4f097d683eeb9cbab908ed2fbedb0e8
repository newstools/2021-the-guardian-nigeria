That’s all you can ask from anybody.” Budenholzer said the Greek standout had made progress over the past two days and was upgraded officially from doubtful to questionable Tuesday afternoon. Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams said his team was ready for the Bucks whether or not Antetokounmpo played. “I think you will see multiple guys on Giannis if he does play. We’re prepared for either situation,” said Williams. “No one has been able to stop him, but you don’t want to give him everything. “He’s a decorated, All-World player, so we know it’s going to take our team defense to try to nullify what he does effectively. “We have to remember who we are and establish the floor with that.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
