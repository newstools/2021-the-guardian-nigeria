Twitter fleets Twitter is shutting down Fleets, the feature which allows users to share text, photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours. The feature will be disappear on August 3 after it failed to gain traction with users In a blog post on Wednesday, Twitter’s head of product, brand and video ads, Ilya Brown said users hadn’t taken to the option the way the company had predicted “We built Fleets as a lower-pressure, ephemeral way for people to share their fleeting thoughts. We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter. “But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped. Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter.” Going forward, Twitter says that it will use what it learned from Fleets to focus on creating other ways for people to “join the conversation” and will find new ways to address “what holds people back from participating on Twitter.” Twitter began testing the Fleet feature in March 2020 and rolled it out globally in November of that year. The feature was its shot at using Stories, the popular social media format invented by Snapchat and further popularized by Instagram, to lower the pressure around tweeting.
