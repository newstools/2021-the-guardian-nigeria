In Hazard’s absence, his place in the Belgian attack goes to Jeremy Doku of Rennes in the only change from the side which beat holders Portugal 1-0 in the last 16. Defender Jan Vertonghen will skipper Belgium. Italy made two changes from the side which beat Austria after extra time in the last 16. Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini returns after injury, replacing Francesco Acerbi in defence. Federico Chiesa’s goal after coming off the bench in the last round earned him a start ahead of Domenico Berardi.
