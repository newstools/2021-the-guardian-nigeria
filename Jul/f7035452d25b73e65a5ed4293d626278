LifeBank has concluded arrangements for the launch of its latest product – AirCo, an agile scalable medical oxygen plant in Nasarawa State. This, the Chief Executive Officer, LifeBank, Temie Giwa-Tubosun said,  is in line with the objective of saving millions of lives across Africa. The official launch of AirCO launch is scheduled to take place in Orozo, Nasarawa State, Tuesday with both physical and virtual participation. According to Giwa-Tubosun, the supply of oxygen has been a major challenge within the healthcare sector in Nigeria. “There are at least 30 oxygen plants but healthcare facilities still run out of supply due to poor maintenance and epileptic electricity. “AirCo is a solution to this supply challenge. This launch will be celebrating LifeBank’s milestone and commendable contribution towards improving better access to healthcare in Nigeria”, the CEO stated. Adding: “At LifeBank, we are driven by impact. We simply cannot accept that hundreds of thousands of our people will die because of something like medical oxygen, particularly up North. “So, my team and I got together to launch AirCo and partnered with oxygen hub. AirCo is a tech and data-driven oxygen PSA plant for the people of Nasarawa and the North Central. “Our goal here is to use our technical innovation to save the lives of the most vulnerable. Thanks to all the people at LifeBank and our partners for making this a success.” The CEO noted that the launch would be insightful and informative. “This commendable work by LifeBank will be one of the many impacts they will have across the country and in Africa. “Currently, LifeBank is already making a difference by providing blood and other medical supplies in Africa.” Giwa-Tubosun informed that attendance would be graced by prominent guests;  Commissioner for Health, Nasarawa state, Managing Directors of hospitals and key stakeholders in the medical, humanitarian and other fields.
