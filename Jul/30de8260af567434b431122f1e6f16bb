The petition also claimed that Nigerian pet owners, “who have dogs and cats as companions and not for consumption”, live in “constant fear of having their companion stolen by local dog or cat thieves, knowing their pet would be sold to a dog trader or butcher, for quick cash.” It added that “local residents and international tourists are placed in jeopardy because of the constant threat to health through transmittable diseases such as rabies, related to Nigeria’s dog and cat meat trade.” “It is unfortunate that Nigeria’s positive new image is tainted by the existence of a cruel dog and cat meat trade which casts a negative shadow over Nigeria. Dogs and cats are companion animals and not food items.” The petition, in conclusion, pleaded with the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari to a list of four action point: (a) Implement existing laws against animal cruelty, maltreatment and neglect.
