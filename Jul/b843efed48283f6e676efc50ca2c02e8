 [FILES] Fire service  Oziwele disclosed this in an interview with The Guardian in his office in Asaba, yesterday. He said: “From the beginning of this year, we have attended to many fire incidents. We have gotten 134 fire calls and 10 false alarms, which we responded to. But the most disastrous one was the February Gas explosion which occurred in Agbor, where many lives were lost.” According to Oziwele, who decried frequent raising of false fire outbreak alarms by residents, the state has 22 fire stations that are truly operational with trucks ready for emergency jobs. “Our men are placed side by side at the 12 fire service posts, which make up the 22 stations spread across strategic locations in the state to prevent and possibly nib in the bud any fire incident, as soon as possible,” he added. Oziwele said: “The causes of fire incidents are many. But the prevalent one is carelessness, which has to do with the way we handle things in our homes and factories.” While appealing to Nigerians to be careful in handling electrical appliances to avoid fire disasters, he warned that using substandard equipment could cause fire outbreak.
