•Clamour for board membership The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) have advocated for a clause in the Petroleum and Industry Bill (PIB) that would help in curbing casualisation of workers in the oil and gas industry. 
 
The unions, which made their position known in a joint statement on the recently passed PIB, said that casualisation of workers in the oil and gas sector was gradually killing the industry, stating that the urgent need to halt the trend through a clause in the bill was pertinent.
 
A statement signed by heads of both unions, clamoured for inclusion on the board of industry regulators for the attainment of objectives of the bill,  to ensure accountability and transparency in the industry.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
