 Wike. Photo/TWITTER/GOVWIKE  Speaking at the official flag-off of civil engineering works for the establishment of the law campus at Rumueme Town in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the State yesterday, Wike said his administration is poised to build, furnish and deliver the best campus of the Nigerian Law School in the city. According to Wike, if the Rivers Government had not initiated to construct two hostels and an auditorium at the Yenagoa Campus of the Nigerian Law School in Bayelsa State, it would have missed the opportunity to request for a Port Harcourt Campus. With the request granted and commencement of construction work at the new Law School site, Governor Wike said Rivers people would be the greatest beneficiaries in terms of employment opportunities the campus will offer and the attendant economic activities within the precinct of the institution. “I’m sure every Rivers man and woman will know that the decision of siting Law School campus in Port Harcourt is very key.” Not only will it help to reduce the number of those who ordinarily will not have the opportunity of going to law school at the time they finish their law programme at the university, it will improve the economy of the State. It will also create employment for our people.” Performing the flag-off, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice,  Abubakar Malami (SAN), who was represented by the Chairman, Council of Legal Education, Chief Nnaemeka Ngige (SAN), recounted how the journey leading to the foundation laying ceremony started with the request made by Governor Wike for a Law School in Port Harcourt. He asserted that the Council of Legal Education has resolved that henceforth, any State Government or group of persons wishing or offering to build a campus of Nigerian Law School in any other part of the country must comply with what is now called the Rivers’ Model.
