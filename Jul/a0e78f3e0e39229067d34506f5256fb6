Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State has decried poor Federal Government’s presence in the state. He was reacting to recent comments by the state’s APC chairman, Ibrahim El-Sudi, that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state failed woefully. Wondering why the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government at the national level has not deemed it fit to site any project in Taraba since coming on board in 2015, Ishaku urged the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency reconsider its position and begin to initiate projects in the state. Speaking through his Special Adviser on Political Matters, Abubakar Bawa, the governor urged the party at the national level to make its presence felt in the state. APC recently frowned on the governor’s interview with Channels Television where he claimed to have impact positively on the 168 wards spread across the state.
