 [FILES] Yobe  Kawu was alleged to be providing information on the movements of troops along the Katarko/Gujba axis of Sambisa Forest. A statement yesterday by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brig-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said Kawu had been carrying out espionage activities in Yobe communities. According to him, the suspect confessed during preliminary investigations that troops’ movements were monitored and relayed to Boko Haram. Nwachukwu explained that more terrorists’ collaborators were deployed in the area to spy on troops’ movements and operations. “The troops of Sector 2 have been placed on red alert and effort is ongoing to unravel the network of informants within the general area. “The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt-Gen. Farouk Yahaya charged them to flush out Boko Haram/ISWAP elements in the area.” “Yahaya also urged law-abiding citizens to continue to avail troops with credible information to enhance their operational efficiency. “He noted that providing credible information could enhance the neutralisation of remnants of terrorists in the forest,” Nwachukwu said.
