 Sympathizers queuing to  pay their last respect<br />PHOTO: DANIEL ANAZIA  T.B Joshua’s son-in-law, Bryan, and his daughters, Serah, Promise, Hart, and his wife Evelyn, were present at the lying-in-state service.  Also, former Ghanaian Minister of Health, Dr. George Yankey, described the late prophet as a great man of God who touched the lives of many people.
  
Founder and President, Belema Oil, Tein Jack-Rich, said Joshua had been a father to him since 2012 when he had an encounter with him and that Joshua picked interest in him to be great.
  
The pastor died on Saturday, June 5, a few days to his 58th birthday. He was born on June 12, 1963. The late founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) had, in an interview with The Guardian, told how he was inspired by Holy Spirit to design the edifice, without help from architects or other building professionals.  Commuters had to alight at Ile Iwe Bus Stop and those who could not afford to board a bike trekked to their destinations.
  
While the passers-by and some who came to pay their respects for the founder of Emmanuel TV called on people in authority to emulate the life of the prophet, some controversially said they wished it were the president who died instead. Policemen around walked away to avoid being captured on camera while the statement was made.
 
A woman said: “Tell me how many politicians can control such a crowd. TB bought rams for Muslims during the festival and he never segregated them. His good deed alone is enough to open the gate of heaven for him.
  
Speaking with The Guardian, Shedrack Aluko said: “I came to Lagos from Delta State because of T.B. Joshua. His teachings and act of generosity changed everything for me. He was indeed a man of God.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
