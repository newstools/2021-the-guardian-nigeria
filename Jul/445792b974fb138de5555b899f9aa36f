GOZ Afro Drill music might still be a novel concept in Naija musicdom, but it is definitely catching on. With the like of Chigozie Basil, better known as GOZ, with his satirical discography, which includes his latest studio release dubbed, ‘Money Anthem’, the genre is fast becoming a household melody, especially among the Nigerian Gen-Z and millennial population. On this Yung Willis production, GOZ emerges with a fine blend of Afro-drill, which also embodies slight Afro-trap fusions. For an Afro-drill song, which are largely freestyled content, GOZ actually soars with his humorous sarcasm, which is the highlight of the track. “Share Money, Share Funds,” he teases the ‘men in power’. The Pixy Entertainment signee disclosed that he created the project as a feel-good melody, which can be relatable by Nigerians. He also said that he is set to release more diverse and interesting songs on his forthcoming EP dubbed, ‘Life of GOZ’. Overall, the project feels like a groovy record with a strong appeal for the dance-floors, while being a light-hearted memoir of our times. Money Anthem is out across all digital streaming platforms.
