Rather, ahead of the 2023 general elections, PMM members insisted on pressing the party for the presidential ticket of the party. The APC group’s position was made known by its National Coordinator, Donald Oota, in a statement yesterday. According to him, North Central remains the only region in the North that is yet to produce either the President or Vice President since 1999. Oota stated that having produced at various times, national chairmen for various ruling parties in the past, the position no longer excited to the people of the zone. He listed past occupants of the post from the region to include the late Soloman Lar, Barnabas Gemade, Audu Ogbe and Ahmadu Ali. The APC chieftain, however, cautioned politicians in the region to put the interest of the zone above personal ambition by rejecting the position of the national chairman instead of the plum position of the President. PMM advised former governor of Benue, George Akume, and his Nasarawa counterpart, Tanko Al-Makura, to stop their jostle for the national chairmanship and join forces with others to clinch the Presidency for the zone. He added: “We are charging our leaders to unite with one another in the onerous task of securing the President for the region. “I call on all parties to look elsewhere for the position of national chairmanship and not North Central. We are not interested. After producing four national chairmen, what else do we do with that position? “Very soon, our group will go round the country to campaign against the position of national chairmanship.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
