 Mambilla Hydro-Electric Power plant  Ishaku, who yesterday made the call during his opening remarks at the ongoing meeting of the North East Governors Forum (NEGF) in Katsina, said if actualised, the project could generate half of the present national power output from all existing generation stations combined. In doing that, the governors, he suggested, just as well work round the clock to ensure that access road to the site in Barup village, on the Mambilla Plateau, is constructed. Stressing that the economic benefits of the project cannot be overemphasised, considering its potential to create hundreds of thousands of skilled and unskilled jobs for Taraba, the North East and the country, he urged the forum, as the voice of the North East, to vigorously advocate the commencement of the project.
