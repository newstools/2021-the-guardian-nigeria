Laurence Griffiths / POOL / AFP England came from behind yesterday to beat Denmark 2-1 in the final semifinal game of the Euro 2020. The Three Lions, playing at home in Wembley, were given the odds to beat Denmark, but they were made to fight for their victory. Yesterday’s victory is England’s first final in the European Championship and their first final in a major championship since they won the World Cup in 1966. Yet it needed Harry Kane’s 104th-minute penalty, to send the majority of the 60,000 fans in attendance into raptures. [aad] The Danes took a 30th-minute lead when Mikkel Damsgaard stunned the home crowd with a brilliant free kick from 25 metres out which flew into the net. It was the first goal England had conceded at the tournament but their response was strong and they were back on level terms nine minutes later. England equalised when Denmark captain Simon Kjær scored an own-goal in the 40th while trying to stop a cross. The regulation time ended 1-1 and the teams had to go another 30 minutes to get the winner. This came when Raheem Sterling was adjudged to have been upended in the box by a Danish defender. The win takes England to Sunday’s final against Italy.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
