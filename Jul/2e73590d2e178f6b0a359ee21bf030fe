IGP Usman Alkali Baba. Photo/TWITTER/POLICENG The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has exempted vehicles with factory-fitted tinted glasses from the ban on issuance of permits. The IGP, who made the clarification during a virtual chat with the media, noted that the decision was taken to stop the abuses associated with the use of tinted glasses and SPY number plates. He also spoke on his vision for the Nigeria Police Force, stating that he will work hard towards entrenching a culture that rewards good deeds and punishes bad ones. Baba emphasised collaboration with sister security agencies and the traditional institutions, including monarchs and community-based groups. The IGP deplored attacks on police formations, especially in the South East, saying concerted and intelligence-driven efforts of his team had drastically reduced criminal activities. The police chief acknowledged that his operatives were cashing in on the ban to harass innocent car owners with factory-fitted tinted glass, adding that measures are ongoing to address the perceived excesses. He said: “Yes, we understand that there are usually issues with policies and their implementation. The directive on tinted glass is not about the factory-fitted ones, but those that are artificially made to cover the whole screens. “If you look at the factory-fitted tinted glasses, you can still see through them and if there is any need for the driver to open the doors, the security officers would know. But those that are not factory-fitted are completely covered so that no one knows who or what they carry. Those are the ones the ban is targeted at.” The IGP had, in June, announced the immediate suspension of tinted glass permits and issuance of SPY number plates in the country.
