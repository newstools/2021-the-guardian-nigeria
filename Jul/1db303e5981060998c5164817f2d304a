The debates of the bills were coordinated by the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, after which the lawmakers made their contributions. While debating the bill for a law to provide for the establishment of the University of Education, Lagos (UNEDLAG), Bisi Yusuff (Alimosho I) said the establishment of the university was important and there should be pre-degree programmes, which he said, was very important in the bill, saying that this will absorb candidates seeking admission. He stressed that there was a provision in the bill that will make the university to be self-independent and that the inclusion of vocational training would also make the students to be self-employed. Sani Okanlawon, in his contribution, advised that Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education (ACOED) and Michael Otedola College of Education should be upgraded to become universities. “The society has rejected Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE) and what is the benefit of going to a school that your certificate will not be recognised. “Admission into this school is the lowest as only 18 applicants chose (ACCOED) as the first choice in the last Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME). With the creation of this varsity, it will reduce the number of applicants to going to LASU,” he said. In his contributions, Gbolahan Yishawu (Eti-Osa II), said the establishment of the university of education is timely. David Setonji said Lagos is ripe enough to have another university due to its large population of primary and secondary schools but with lesser teachers, saying: “The university would come to the rescue.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
