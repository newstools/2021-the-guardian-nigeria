He stated this yesterday after inspecting the progress of signaling and communication on the Lagos-Ibadan railway line at Ibadan, Oyo State. According to him, the trains operating on the route were bought in 2016, stating that the ministry has written to President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the purchase of new ones.
