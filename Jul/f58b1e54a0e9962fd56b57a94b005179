Adeosun, who lived in the UK until she was 34, said she had been told she was exempted from the mandatory service because she was over 30.

Adeosun eventually resigned after months of speculation in local media about whether her NYSC was genuine. The former investment banker said she felt bound to resign after the investigation result became known. “This has come as a shock to me and I believe that in line with this administration’s focus on integrity, I must do the honourable thing and resign,” Adeosun said.

The court, however, did not speak on the allegation that Adeosun forged the certificate.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
