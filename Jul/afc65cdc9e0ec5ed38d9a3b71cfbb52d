 Mahdi Gusau  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned alleged attempt by the police to undermine the statutory powers of the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Gusau. PDP said its position was predicated on reported police harassment of Gusau, including “unlawful and vexatious obstruction of a planned rally by the deputy governor.” The National Publicity Secretary of the major opposition party, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted: “Instead of harassing the deputy governor, the police, as agents of the law, should be providing him with all the protection and privileges, particularly as the formal process for his official declaration, given the vacation of office (of governor) by Bello Matawalle, has already commenced at the Federal High Court.” ALSO, socio-cultural groups in Benue State have warned those organising campaign of calumny against Governor, Samuel Ortom, especially in the media, to desist or face the people’s wrath. The groups, including the three main socio-cultural groups in the state, Mdzough U Tiv (MUT), Ochetoha K’ Idoma (OKI) and Omi Ny’Igede (ONI), sounded the warning yesterday at a press conference in Makurdi. Reading a statement on behalf of the other groups, President General of MUT Worldwide and Chairman of the other groups, Iorbee Ihagh, a retired Commissioner of Police (CP), noted that those tasked with the responsibility of disparaging the governor “have stopped at nothing” in their mission to put his name and office in disrepute. They stated: “We, as leaders of the three main socio-cultural groups in Benue, want to make it abundantly clear to those casting aspersions on our governor that they are up against the entire people of Benue. Any attack on Governor Ortom is an attack on all of us. We will not fold our arms to watch anyone unbraid our governor in the manner that such groups are doing.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
