Specdo, whose latest single ‘Ginger’ is currently ruling the airwaves across the country, revealed this in a chat with journalists in Lagos. Following a successful musical career with top-notched singles such as ‘Oyoyo’, ‘Manya’, Blow My Mind and Branama, emerging Afro-Pop Superstar, Specdo, has again dropped Ginger, a song he described as a motivation for all and sundry. The single, produced by Solshynbeat Mix, and mastered by Indomix, comes just in time when ‘afrobeats to the world’ has gained solid grounds across the globe, particularly with international recognition accorded the trio of Burna Boy, Wizkid and Davido recently. Although singers often get the accolades, Specdo credited his record label and management for being responsible for his success this far, saying, “TMY Records is not a baby record label. We have been existing since 2012. You all know the music for an upcoming artist is off and on due to financial difficulties.” He continued: “TMY Records label is the future of the African music industry. I believe the energy we applied to get here today can also move us to be the best record label like Mavin Records. TMY Record is here to produce and monetize other stars in Africa at large. “We own TMY media group which is a media and management company with professional celebrity professional public relations outfit.  We own music equipment to boost talents which we are still upgrading to meet the industry standard so we can stay up the game. “My teams are the best. I always appreciate my managers- King Okoye, Naomi Adams and Chuchi. They play big roles in TMY Group.  They are a great support and family that make things work smarter and smoothly for me.” Born into a middle-class family, Specdo draws strength from the daily dose of counsel his late father, Prophet Johnson Ajayi, used to give him. When things were beginning to look good, he built the late prophet a house then valued at about N15 million. For Specdo, churning out good music is an obsession turned full-time job and he has promised to continue to keep his fans happy with impeccable lyrics that will stand the test of time. He is been described as the natural successor to King TuBaba who, incidentally, he sees as his mentor and inspiration.
