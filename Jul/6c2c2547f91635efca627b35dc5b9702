Associates and supporters of Yoruba self-determination fighter, Mr. Sunday Adeyemo, known as Sunday Igboho, yesterday protested the recent raid of Igboho’s house by officials of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Army.
 
Dressed in black attires, the protesters, who marched along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, starting from Soka Bus Stop, asked the Federal Government to stop hunting Igboho.
 
They also demanded the release of his families, friends and associates arrested during the raid.  The DSS confirmed the invasion and arrest of 13 persons during the raid.
 
But, family members and Igboho’s supporters, during the peaceful protest, described the arrest as illegal.
 
They claimed the protest was going on  simultaneously in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK), declaring  that it would continue today in Ibadan and other states in the South West. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
