 [ FILES] Enugu  The Chairman of the Livestock Market, Alhaji Danladi Abubarkar, who disclosed this yesterday in a chat with newsmen, said the deaths occurred in the early hours of the day. Abubarkar said residents in the market area woke up to discover the dead bodies, which included four men and three women. He said that all the affected persons, which included tricycle riders, artisans and others from different households, were stooling and vomiting. “The bodies are still in their rooms as we speak. We shall soon proceed to the cemetery to bury the Muslims among them while the Christians will be taken by their relatives,” he said. Officials of the Enugu State Ministry of Health had already visited the area to investigate the course of the deaths. The leader of the team, who pleaded anonymity, described the situation as worrisome, saying all the deceased were in no way related. The source said that there could be a possible outbreak of epidemic in the area, adding that medical doctors at the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital had been alerted. He directed that those in critical conditions should be immediately rushed to the said hospital and the eight persons were immediately taken to the place in a bus with the inscription, ‘Olamaboro Local Government Council’. When contacted, the Executive Secretary, Enugu State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. George Ugwu, said that it was premature to speak on the matter, as no one was sure on the cause of the deaths. Ugwu, however, said a team of health experts had been sent to the place to get more information.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
