He also noted that the petroleum product, suspected to be adulterated AGO, otherwise known as diesel, was concealed in 420 jerry cans of 25 litres each, which is approximately 10,500 litres. He added that the suspects, who had made useful information to the corps, would soon be arraigned in court on completion of on-going investigation.
