The bank’s Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, who spoke at a media parley in Lagos, initiated a seven-point agenda of the bank to include innovation, workforce transformation, digital transformation, brand refresh, service excellence, performance discipline, and accelerated growth. Onyeali-Ikpe, as the first female CEO of the bank, said the bank has concluded plans to embark on innovation drive, through the implementation of new processes and techniques. “The bank is also executing fresh ideas to ensure continuous process improvement, reduce the cost to serve, increase competitiveness, improve brand recognition and value, build new partnerships and relationships, drive turnover, and increase profitability,” she said. She said the bank would embark on a brand refresh with the aim to increase top-of-mind awareness of the Fidelity brand by external and internal stakeholders. Onyeali-Ikpe added that the company would ensure workforce transformation to create a future readily supported by a high-performing and empowered workforce. “This will be achieved by deepening the skills and competencies of staff across the bank, entrenching a culture of high performance, and embedding new ways of working in the bank. “Commencement of capacity building for staff and senior management training is one of the initiatives implemented,” she said. She stressed that service excellence intended to build brand loyalty through personalised and seamless customer experience delivery was underway with the virtual assistant IVY. The Fidelity Bank’s chatbot – IVY – received a high ranking in the recent KPMG ratings. “This revolutionary chatbot handles simple tasks such as account opening and complex tasks such as complaint resolution, bill payment, transferring users to a live agent, loans, fixed deposit applications and answering random questions,” she said. Onyeali-Ikpe said that other initiatives of the bank geared toward deepening growth include renewal of institutional banking and drive for transaction-based propositions in corporate banking.
