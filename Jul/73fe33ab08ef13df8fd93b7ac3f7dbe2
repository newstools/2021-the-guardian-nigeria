   According to the convener, Muhammed Kabir Rotimi, the academy thought it wise to launch the programme for more youths to channel their energy to sports and shun social vices. Rotimi said the academy took the decision to work with the council to create more awareness to educate parents on the need to allow their wards take part in sports and combine with quality education right from their formative stage. He noted that one of the key areas to uncover more sporting talents in the society was to provide the enabling platform where youths can train regularly after school in various sports. “Great Future Academy is an academy that started with taekwondo. We decided to add more sports to ensure large number of children and youths get involved in any sports of their choice. I discovered around the environment there are no areas for children to train and horn their skills because houses are built everywhere. “So, for children and youths to display their talents, Great Future Academy has now provided a platform for people to train and develop their sporting potential under experienced coaches. “Our dream is to see most of them train in the academy and win laurels for the country in future through grooming and exposing themselves to competitions. Some of our athletes groomed in the academy won gold medals in taekwondo at the just-concluded National Sports Festival in Edo State. So, this is a testimony that we are exceling at the academy,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
