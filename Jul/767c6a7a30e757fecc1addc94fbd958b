The group gave the warning in a statement signed by the Jagunmolu Agbekoya of Yorubaland, Kunle Adelakun (Eruobodo), titled: ‘’Re-Invasion of Sunday Adeyemo’s House and the Clampdown on Yoruba Nation Agitators by the Federal Government.” The Agbekoya warriors warned that failure to listen to the advice might cause unnecessary and avoidable political tension in the country. The group added that the country had already been charged and the Buhari government should not add to the situation. “The Aare Agbekoya of Yorubaland, Olalere Ayalu; the Iyalode Agbekoya, Ramota Bogunmbe; the National Co-ordinator and Jagunmolu Agbekoya of Yorubaland, Kunle Adelakun (Eruobodo); the Agbekoya Elders Council and the Irunmole Agbekoya are unanimously calling on the Federal Government, under President Muhammadu Buhari, to back off from any attempt to arrest Prof. Banji Akintoye, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, Iba Gani Adams and every key member of Yoruba Nation agitation. “Failure to listen to this advice might cause unnecessary and avoidable political tension in the country. The country has already been charged and the Buhari government should not add to the situation. RELATEDLY, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, yesterday, said there were agitations and restiveness among Nigerian youths because of frustration and lack of opportunities in the country. Oba Adetunji stated this while commissioning a technological hub set up by a young Nigerian, Lord Smith Emeka Eze, at the Felele area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The monarch attributed various vices among the youths to unemployment, frustration and lack of economic advancement. He, therefore, urged other youths to emulate Emeka by creating opportunities for themselves notwithstanding the situation of the country.
