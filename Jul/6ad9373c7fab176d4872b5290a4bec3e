In its market forecast for the month of July, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “We note that some stocks are trading within their buy ranges to become more attractive at this point for income investors and traders, even as the market anticipates positive news, while oil price continues to oscillate above $73pb to support global economic and stock market recovery across climates. “We also expect the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination to support global and domestic economic recovery that will enhance the market and give direction. The banking sector and others remain attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the Q1 mixed numbers. “However, the strong and faster recovery may continue, depending on market forces, going forward, as propelled by expected Q2 earnings reports, until the next MPC meeting in July.” He urged investors to target dividend-paying stocks and companies with growth prospects in 2021 ahead of the interim dividend announcement. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited said: “With the H1, 21 earnings season on the horizon, we believe investors will be looking for clues on the sustainability of the decent corporate earnings release for Q1-21. “However, we expect mixed market performance in the week ahead as bargain hunting in dividend-paying stocks will be matched by intermittent profit-taking activities.” 43 equities appreciated last week, higher than 33 in the preceding week. 26 equities depreciated lower than 37 equities in the previous week, while 87 equities remained unchanged higher than 85 equities recorded in the previous week.
