The Chief Executive Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omordion said: “Selloff and profit booking persisted ahead of inflation data and monetary policy meeting outcome as consumer price index had recently slid for two consecutive months in the face of a weak economic recovery. “Investors are on the sidelines, despite not expecting a change in monetary policy at this pace of growth and recovery as uncertainty looms,” he said. Codros Capital said: “We believe the outcome of the bond auction scheduled to hold next week will shape market sentiments. As a result, we expect investors to trade cautiously while taking positions in stocks with attractive dividend yields ahead of H1, 2021 dividend declarations, which intermittent profit-taking activities would match. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Further analysis of last week’s trading indicated that the nation’s equities market reopened on a negative note on Monday, following losses suffered by most blue-chip stocks, especially CWG, International Breweries, and Champion Breweries, as market capitalisation plunged by N71 billion.
