China’s Communist Party (CCP) has come a long way to celebrate its hundred years of formation, dated back to July 1, 1921 by the foremost leaders, the Marxist philosopher, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxio and Mao Zedong who became the Chairman of CCP. The fortuitous journey till date is, however, the story of sacrifice, perseverance, resilience and determination to succeed which did not just start 100 years ago but also dated back to the era of fore-fathers who were concerned about the future of China and did not count their lives to be anything, so far the future generation enjoy the legacy they left behind. Such characteristics are only synonymous with nationals that determine to carry their nations to the next level and not leaders who believe they are in governance to amass wealth even to the detriment of the citizens and survival of the nation, who apparently do not care whose ox is gored.  No wonder, China that operates on zero tolerance for corruption, believes that as long as indulgence is given to mediocrity, judgment is subjugated by way of preference, China’s dream of a nation as it is today would remain elusive.  Today, China, can then be rightly described as a nation inspired by its past going by her history and artifacts that bear record to the struggles of the fore-fathers. It is not just enough to hail China’s Communist Party for its centenary celebration for coming thus far but to see the lesson developing nations especially in Africa can learn from China’s unrelentless journey bordering on determination of China’s fore fathers to leave a legacy for up-coming generations, even if they would not personally reap the reward of their sacrifice. China today, apart from internal crisis, has survived subjugation to Western powers and Japan in the 19th and 20th centuries while it would be agreed that the country being found today as the world’s second largest economy is not the story of a feat to be dismissed in a hurry. China’s story of ruggedness is better told with physical scenery such as Great Wall, which was built by many Chinese Emperors to keep out northern invaders like the Mongols including contribution during the Ming Dynasty which won him the accreditation ‘‘Ming Great Wall.’’ Again, China’s gradual rise to stardom, culminating into the centenary celebration of the Communist party, her technological breakthroughs, her economic boost could be leveraged on her determination for relevance among comity of nations. CCP when founded in 1921 had its first National Congress with only 50 members but today, it is the second largest political party in the world with over 95 million members. History has it that CCP after it was founded in 1921 grew quickly and by 1949, it had driven the Kuomintang (KMT)’s Nationalist Government from mainland China to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Mao Zedong, popularly referred to as Chairman Mao who could also be regarded as the principal architect of the new China was born December 26, 1893 and became the leader of CCP in 1935 who remained in office until his death in September 9, 1976. He was succeeded by Hua Guofend who lost power to Vice Chairman, Dang Xiaoping, who became the de-facto leader of China. The post of chairman was abolished in 1982 and replaced by the title General Secretary to be adopted by the head of the party. 
The current leader, General Secretary Xi Jinping was elected at the 18th Central Committee on November 15, 2012. As it is entrenched in the constitution, the Party’s leader holds the offices of the general secretary who is responsible for civilian party duties, Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), responsible for military affairs and State President (a larger ceremonial position).  The party leader assumes these posts to become the country’s paramount leader like Xi Jinping. President Xi Jinping in his address during the centenary celebration in Beijing described the Chinese nation as a great nation with history of more than 5,000 years, that has made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilisation. “After the Opium War of 1840, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before.  The country endured intense humiliation and since that time, national rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. “Through tenacious struggle, the party and the Chinese people have shown the world that the Chinese nation has achieved the tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong, and that China’s national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability” he said. He attributed the achievement of over the past hundred years of struggle by China to the concerted efforts of the Chinese Communists, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation. “Chinese Communists, with comrades Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao as their chief representatives, have made tremendous and historic contributions to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  To them, we express our highest respect” Xi said. He remarked that the more than 180-year long modern history of the Chinese nation, the 100-year-long history of the Party, and the more than 70-year-long history of the People’s Republic of China, all provide ample evidence that without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation. According to China’s Consul General in Lagos, Chu Maoming, commenting on the centenary celebration of CCP concentration on Africa to make the continent China’s largest trading partner is a task.  Already, China had direct investment of US$3 billion in the year 2020 alone with Africa. China looks forward to continuous bi-lateral relations with countries in Africa, aiming at building China-Africa community with a shared future. There is no doubt that over these five years, Xi has made his mark as a successful General Secretary of CCP.  He has dealt with corruption officials while his success today epitomizes the CCP’s success over the years.
