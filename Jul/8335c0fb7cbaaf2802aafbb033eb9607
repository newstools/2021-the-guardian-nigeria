Delta State Police Command said it has arrested over 100 suspected cultists, foiled initiation of others, recovered AK 50 rifle and 19 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunitions.  
  
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bright Edafe, who confirmed the arrest, said: “Police team, while on patrol along Ibusa-Ogwashi-Uku –Issele-Azagba Road, after Ogwashi-Uku Polytechnic, received information that a group of suspected cultists came out from the bush with intent to cause mayhem.” Following the information, he said the Rapid Respond Squad (RRS) team immediately went after the suspected cultists, where there was an exchange of gunshots, but they could not withstand the firepower of the Police. They, therefore, threw away one AK 50 rifle with breach No. NA48333 containing a full loaded magazine, with 19 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunitions while escaping. Edafe also disclosed that a cult initiation process was foiled on July 3, by SACU operatives at Ogume community, Delta State.
 According to him, SACU operatives stormed the bush at night, and successfully arrested over 28 suspects, in addition to arresting eight suspected Aiye Confraternity cult members in Warri. He said the confessional statement of one of the suspects led to the arrest of one Lucky Eluagu (m) alias DJ Lucky, aged 27years at Okpe Street Jeddo, Okpe Local Council.
  
The PPRO further said the Police at Oviwan-Aladja Division, acting on a distress call went after suspected armed robbers operating at a bush bar in Otor-Udu, but on sighting the Police, attempted to escape on a motorcycle. They were, however, chased by the patrol teams, and while two of the suspects escaped, one was arrested. Edafe revealed that the arrested suspect, one Umukoro Collins, was in possession of one locally made pistol and one live cartridge.
