The groups, in their suit, numbered FHC/ABC/CS/1006/202 and which has the President and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) as defendants, alleged marginalisation of the gender in the governance of the country. The case, which was before Justice Okon Abang (now in the Warri Division of the court), is now being handled by Justice Okorowo, who, on hearing the submissions of counsel, adjourned till September 29, for adoption of written addresses. The plaintiffs are complaining of the “consistent gender imbalance in terms of decision-making processes in the country, as well as the continued marginalisation of the female gender.” They want the court to restrain the President from further exercising the constitutional and statutory powers of appointment in a manner violative of the 35 per cent affirmative action policy of the Federal Government as contained in the National Gender Policy, 2006.
