The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed on Thursday said the leader of the  proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu has been living a luxurious lifestyle in different countries before he was re-arrested. “He was travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes,” Mohammed said at a media briefing on Thursday in Abuja. “Of course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested,’’ he said. Mohammed also stated that security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the IPOB leader for two years. The minister said Kanu’s re-arrest and repatriation was made possible through the collaboration of Nigerian security and intelligence agencies. He described the re-arrest and repatriation as “one of the most classic operations of its type in the world.” Mohammed, however, did not comment on the speculations on how the re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed. “What we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations,” Mohammed said. “We will continue to respect and honour the obligations.’’ Kanu is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms, among others. He jumped bail in 2017 and left the country. Kanu was re-arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday and ordered to be remanded in the custody of the DSS, while the case was adjourned till July 26 and July 27.
