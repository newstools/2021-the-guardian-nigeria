Following Delta’s team win over Abia Valiants, who they beat 24-21, Coach Samson Okotie has predicted that his team would win the women category of the Premier League.
 
“My aim is to take the team to the elite division after beating our closest rival, Abia Valiants. We are poised to pick one of the two qualification tickets. Having failed in 2019 under Coach Theodore Iyoga, Delta State Sports Council gave me a mandate to take the team to the elite class.”  Coach Okotie commended everyone involved in putting the division one championship together; a feat, he said, was rare at a time the world is experiencing a downturn in fortunes.
