“Hustle” art cover | Teni If you have ever had a first-hand experience of the pains and sacrifices it takes to attain success, then you would relate well with “Hustle,” the new music video by Nigerian singer Teni. The song itself echoes the less-talked about struggle behind success and fame. “Sometimes, it feels like success is a trap,” Teni sings in the opening verse of the song. Where some may seem to have it easy, the road to success is mostly tarred with tears, criticism, losses, as well as expectations from family, friends and foes. These are some of the themes of “Hustle”. “Sometimes I gas pour water on top my head,
Make this pressure no drive me insane o,” Teni sings in another verse. In the music video, Teni’s character depicts the story of a wannabe musician who finds herself in between a mother who constantly criticises her and a loving father who believes in her dream. Unfortunately that relationship with her father was cut short when he died after his car swerved and plunged into the lagoon (a probable visual allusion to the tragic loss of her own father who was murdered in 1995).
