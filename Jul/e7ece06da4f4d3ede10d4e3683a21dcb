Ebuehi, this week, completed a move to Venezia from Benfica, with the Lagunari having the option of buying the multitalented defender, who is comfortable as a right or left fullback if they remain in Serie A for the 2022/23 campaign. The 25-year-old Nigerian international spent this past season on loan at Dutch club FC Twente. He started 33 of Twente’s 34 league matches during the campaign, even scoring a goal. And, according to Mattia Collauto, Venezia’s sporting director, the Lagunrani have secured a top-level player in the Nigerian, who looks set to give the club’s first-choice right-back Pasquale Mazzocchi a good fight for a spot in the starting-XI. Speaking at Ebuehi’s official presentation, Collauto said: “Ebuehi has different characteristics compared to Mazzocchi. In the past years, he was one of the best prospects in his role. Last year he had a very good campaign with Twente and I think he is coming at the right time to the Italian championship. The team’s technical depth is increasing, as this is a top-level player.” Born in 1995 in Haarlem, in the Netherlands, Ebuehi started his career at ADO Den Haag, going on to make his debut in the Eredivisie in the 2014/15 season. He joined Benfica in the 2019/20 season, months after featuring for Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but his time at the Portuguese club was marred by a career-threatening injury. Upon his return from injury, he was unable to reclaim his spot in the first team and opted to go out on loan to Twente last season. Throughout his career, Ebuehi has also earned 10 caps for the Nigeria national team and is fast becoming a regular in the Super Eagles. He is expected to also become a regular at Venezia and one of the players that coach Paolo Zanetti will be banking on to keep the club in the Italian top flight this coming season after a 19-year absence from the Italian topflight.
