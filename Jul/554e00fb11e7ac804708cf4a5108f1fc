Lagos State Government has designed a competition for schoolchildren between the ages of four and 12, to drive its tree-planting campaign, which will take off on July 14.
   
In the campaign, children would create any art form that interprets this year’s tree-planting theme: ‘Restore and Recover,’ while participants with the best entries would be rewarded with learning resources like electronic tablets, books and other educational materials.
 
General Manager, Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK), Mrs. Adetoun  Popoola, disclosed this during a media conference on  the state’s plans for this year’s Tree Planting Day, which is celebrated yearly on July 14.
 
She said the state had also designed  an online book reading and a question-and-answer session for children scheduled for the Saturday, July 10 event.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
