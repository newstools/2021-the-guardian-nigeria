Residents in Greenfield Estate, a bustling middle-class neighbourhood in Amuwo Odofin local council area of Lagos State has lamented increasing insecurity and epileptic power supply in the area. According to the residents, the popular business hub of many flourishing plazas, hotels, offices and schools has become a shadow of itself as a result of poor power supply despite very ‘crazy’ bills, rising insecurity, poor drainage network, flooding, lack of street lights and bad roads. In a bid to find lasting solutions to these problems bedeviling the community, the residents elected and inaugurated a new estate executive council led by Monday Akunna, recently. Speaking after his inauguration, Akunna affirmed that he was ready to face the daunting task of leading the community. “I am very happy to serve the people and I have rolled out my 10-point agenda. I want to improve electricity supply; we don’t enjoy power here. I want to make sure we have constant light daily.” I want to improve the security and ensure all the boundaries in the estate are closed and sealed with barbed wires and gates; I want to fix all the roads and ensure residents enjoy good health. We have several committees, 17 in all that will face different projects within the community,” he said.
 
Newly elected PRO, Chigozie Njoku, also said they were ready to solve the problems and leave a lasting legacy in the community.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
