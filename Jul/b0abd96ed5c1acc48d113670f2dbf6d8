Adegoke, who won the 100m gold medal for Edo State at the 2020 National Sports Festival, will get both financial and moral support he needs to succeed in Tokyo from Shaibu. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s former captain to many Games and Championships, Yussuf Alli, has commended the deputy governor for Edo government’s support to Adegoke. “As a former athlete, who competed in many games and championships, the moral support of your government and people is a crucial morale booster. If that moral support is now backed with cash support, that is massive. I commend Deputy Governor Shaibu for this brilliant initiative, which will not only encourage Edo athletes to give their best but also encourages all athletes representing Nigeria in major games and championships.” Alli also commend the Edo State government for its massive investment in sports infrastructures and equipment, “Before the Godwin Obaseki/Shaibu administration in Edo State, athletes from the state had to travel elsewhere to train because the state lacked facilities and equipment. But thanks to massive investment by this administration, Edo athletes now train in all the nooks and crannies of the state. We now host world-class championships, including the National Sports Festival and the Super Eagle matches,” Alli stated.
