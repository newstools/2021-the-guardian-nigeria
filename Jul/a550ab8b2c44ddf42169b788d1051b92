Oli London, British Influencer Identifies As Korean After Eighteen Surgeries Oli London, an influencer born in England has hit back at criticism after undergoing multiple surgeries and revealing they now “identify as Korean”. Oli London, 31, is a singer and internet personality with more than 800,000 followers across Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. London, who is non-binary, released a video on YouTube revealing they had undergone 18 rounds of plastic surgery to look like BTS star Park Ji-min, also known as Jimin. The surgeries include a facelift, brow lift, eye surgery, temple lift as well as new veneers, they explained. London said they were now “feeling really good” after being very unhappy with who they were deep down for the last eight years. In a video, they said: For the first time in my life, I feel beautiful. I’m looking in the mirror and I love the way I look and feel happy, and I hope people can respect my decision. I know a lot of people don’t understand me, but I do identify as Korean, and I do look Korean now. I do feel Korean. I don’t identify as British, so please don’t refer to me as British, because I identify as Korean. That’s just my culture, that’s my home country. That’s exactly how I look now, and I also identify as Jimin – that’s my Korean name. They also posted a rainbow version of the Korean flag to Twitter, tweeting that was their “new official flag for being a non-binary person who identifies as Korean”. They also claimed “Transracial is a thing”, tweeting: “I invented it! If you can be transgender you can be Transracial.” In a statement sent to Sky News, the 31-year-old said: I’m not about negativity or sparking controversy. At the end of the day, I’m a human being living in my truth. It’s an unfortunate reality for so many to have to hide who they truly are.
