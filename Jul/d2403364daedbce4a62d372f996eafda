Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on behalf of President Buhari (middle), commissioning the Falcon Eye project at the naval headquarters in Abuja…yesterday. The Federal Government may have taken a bold step to put an end to terrorism and sea robbery on Nigeria’s maritime space with the launch of Falcon Eye, yesterday, in Abuja by President Muhammadu Buhari. Falcon Eye is a facility that has the capacity to spot, chase and interdict maritime criminals quietly and efficiently on the nation’s sea lanes. At the launch of the security technology platform, Buhari, who was represented by the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, noted that the Falcon Eye system would serve as a force multiplier for naval platforms tasked with securing Nigeria’s maritime environment from external aggression. The system, according to him, would also enable the Nigerian Navy to effectively combat any crimes that could disrupt the conduct of maritime trade. He said: “The Falcon Eye system is a state-of-the-art surveillance facility that incorporates various sensors located along the nation’s enormous coastline, such as Radars, long range Electro Optic Systems with thermal or night vision capability, Automatic Identification System receivers, Weather Stations and marine Very High Frequency Radios for communication.” National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno, noted that the project was an initiative of his office.
He said the project was borne out of the necessity to combat the myriad of security challenges within the maritime sector.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
