Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court, Abuja has admitted former Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Adedibu Ojerinde, to bail in the sum of N200 million in his alleged fraud trial. The presiding judge, while ruling on the application yesterday, held that bail is at the discretion of the court, adding that there was no evidence before him contradicting the defendantâ€™s request. He, therefore, ordered Ojerinde to produce two sureties in like sum, who must be residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and show evidence of tax payments. One of the guarantors, Justice Egwuatu added, must be an authentic professor in a federal university, while the other must own landed property in Abuja, verifiable by the court. He subsequently adjourned the case till July 22 and 23 for further trial. The defendant was charged by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC) for alleged N5.2 billion misappropriation.
