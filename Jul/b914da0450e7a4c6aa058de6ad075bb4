The 33-year-old rapper tweeted about his diagnosis on Wednesday, and added that he wasn’t suffering from any symptoms as at that moment. “Okay loved ones….sooo…..Ya boy got covid. No symptoms. Just stay away from me for a lil while,” Wiz Khalifa wrote on his Twitter page. Khalifa added that, while he’s quarantining, he’ll be focusing his energy on creativity. “While im in the house I’ll be givin y’all new content, planning raves, and readying this new project,” he tweeted. Earlier of this year, Wiz released two mixtapes, #FUCC2020 and Taylor Nights. He also unveiled a deluxe 10-year anniversary edition of his third studio album Rolling Papers, which included a new version of “Black and Yellow” with Juicy J, Snoop Dogg and T-Pain; verses from Chevy Woods, Nikkiya and Poo Bear; and an added feature from Nipsey Hussle. The “See You Again” rapper did not say whether or not he’s been vaccinated against COVID-19. According to PEOPLE, experts say there is a slim chance of vaccinated people becoming infected compared to those who have not received the shots. Though developing COVID-19 after getting fully vaccinated is rare, it is possible and “expected,” the Centers for Disease Control say, as the vaccines are not 100 percent effective against the virus.
