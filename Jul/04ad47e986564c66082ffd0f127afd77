The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State has said its ward congress will hold on July 24 and not July 10 as reported in various quarters. Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife, in a statement, yesterday, urged party faithful to discountenance directives to the contrary, saying it has also notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) about the July 24 date. The statement reads: “Our party faithful in all parts of Anambra State and across all cadres are hereby advised that ward congresses of the party have been fixed for Saturday, July 24, 2021, subject to the confirmation and/or adjustment of the national secretariat. “This rules out any such event next Saturday, July 10, 2021, as has been transmitted by some persons with varying levels of tension in many locations. “Our party faithful in Ogbaru, Onicha North, Nnewi South, Aguata, Orumba North, Orumba South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo, among other local governments are to take particular note. “We seize this opportunity to remind INEC that while our party may have considered July 10 in the distant past, such is already overtaken by events.” “At a period in which our party is set to kick off a fruitful journey to Government House, Awka, we urge our teeming membership and the general public to stay vigilant and report any suspicious movement in any ward to the local government chairman or local government publicity secretaries of the party for further action.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
