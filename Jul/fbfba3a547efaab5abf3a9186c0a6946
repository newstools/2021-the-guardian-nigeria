It can be as easy as throwing on a pair of shades, wearing your shirt loosely or adding more layers to your accessories. A key to being stylish is confidence. So we have gathered some tips for you to look stylish without trying too hard. Here are four ways to keep the compliments rolling. Val. Photo Instagram – valsgramm 1.Colour Coordinate
Pairing colours can either make or break your outfit. So it’s only normal to feel uneasy when trying out new tones. But, that doesn’t mean you should not experiment. Some popular colour options are green and yellow, pale blue and pink, orange and blue, the list goes on. Then you can pull your look together with makeup and accessories. Tia.

Mix and match a bunch of different fabrics in one look – knitwear, suede, animal print, leather, silk for a super chic look. You can decide to keep them all in the same colour range but with different textures. Toke Makinwa… Photo Instagram – tokemakinwa 3.Wear a matching set
Matching sets are one of the most fashionable outfits. Any two-piece like skirt suit, pantsuit or even sweatsuit looks automatically hip. Rihanna. Photo Pinterest 4.Monochrome
Pick one colour and go all out! This makes getting dressed easier and a lot faster since it narrows down your choices, and you don’t have to spend too much time thinking of what colours to pair.
