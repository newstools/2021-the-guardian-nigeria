The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has shut down the student hostels over the rise in reported cases of coronavirus on the campus. A source told The Guardian that the University Senate has directed that all students vacate the halls of residence latest by 12.00 noon on Thursday 15 July 2021. The source said no access will be granted to any student after 12.00 noon on 15 July. “The hostels will be locked indefinitely therefore students are advised to move all their personal effects at once,” the source said. All lessons are expected to go virtual from Monday, July 26. Our correspondent learned that students have already started removing their belongings from the hostel as at 3:30 pm when they got the directive from the office of the dean of student affairs. The Guardian also learned that some physical classes scheduled for Thursday have been rescheduled to hold virtually to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the students. The school said in a statement on Tuesday that it is seeing “an increase in the number of patients presented to the University of Lagos Medical Centre with flu-like symptoms which are similar to COVID-19. “The Medical Centre hereby assures all members of the University community, that all necessary actions in line with the Federal and Lagos State Government guidelines have been taken regarding this potential threat in our community. “The Medical Centre will also return to providing emergency only services during this period, in order to protect all members of the community from potential infection within the facility.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
