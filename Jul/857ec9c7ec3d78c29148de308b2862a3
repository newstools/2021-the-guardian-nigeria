 Oyo State governor Seyi Makinde  The incumbent urged the public to discountenance half-baked and uninformed criticisms over the award of the contract to SEL-Vydra, a consortium, saying, “Uninformed sources and opposition elements had been criticising the contract award that SEL-Vydra was registered less than two months ago. Efforts to portray the process as flawed were based on ignorance and lack of information on processes for awarding contracts to consortia. “ The choices before the people of Oyo State are clear. It is between the award of a 32-kilometre first phase of the Circular Road for N70 Billion to an old company that did 3kms in three years and the award of the entire road spanning 110 kilometres for N138.2 billion, using a Special Purpose Vehicle and a promised delivery of the first phase before the end of the tenure of the administration in 2023. “Second, the controversies being raised about the length of time SEL-Vydra was registered before it got the Circular Road project should not have arisen if the people spreading the misinformation had bothered to seek information. “SEL-Vydra is a consortium of companies coming together for the purpose of the concession. It is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that involves the coming together of different companies already registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. So, the registration of the SPV should not be a source of any controversy.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
