 Bello Matawalle  Balarabe, however, said the Special Adviser on Security, retired DIG Mamman Tsafe was not affected by the development. “It is hereby notified for general information that Gov. Bello Matawalle, has relieved all Special Advisers of their appointments, except the Special Adviser on Security matters. “This decision is in line with the recent defection to the APC and to allow for an in-depth search of more but competent hands in the administration of the state, irrespective of political affiliations,” he said. Balarabe directed all the affected Special Advisers to hand over affairs of their respective offices, and government property under them to their Directors General and/or Accounting officers. He also extended the governor’s appreciation to them for their contributions towards the development of the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor had in February, sacked all Commissioners, Special Advisers and Directors-General, but re-appointed some of them in April. Matawalle had on June 29, formally defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), after several months of speculations.
