Specifically, Investdata Consulting Limited said: “There is no need to panic at this point because profit taking is an integral part of stock market dynamics anytime. It drives oscillation that creates room for entry and exit. “So Investors and traders should not be carried away with any rally or rebound, but be guided by their investment objectives, while taking profit immediately reasonable profit targets are met.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage firm said: “We expect next week’s activity to follow the same pattern observed in the last few sessions, with sell-offs followed by price appreciation. “We anticipate a mixed activity level in the market with the banking sector likely to dominate trading once more.
