This is a journalist working with the Cable Newspaper, Deji and a cameraman attached to the AGTV, Jeromi Godwin, who wanted to report the proposed protest, were arrested and detained for over four hours at the church security post.
 
Following the arrest of five youths wearing ‘Buhari Must Go’ T-shirts to the church during the last week Sunday service by the Department of Security Services (DSS), the pro-democracy campaigner  had threatened to organise a mass protest if the affected youths were not released within seven days.  They collected my phone so that I will not be able to make calls.” But the  AGTV reporter, Jethro Iliya, who described the detention of the reporter as unjust and unprofessional, lamented that despite presenting his identification card, the cameraman was detained like a criminal for hours
 
Another journalist, Ayodeji  Owolabi of The Cable Newspapers, who was also detained, told The Guardian that he was detained from 7.30a.m. to 12.45p.m. despite showing them his identity card. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
