Weeks after welcoming his fifth and sixth children, Nick Cannon is now a dad of seven after his presumed current girlfriend Alyssa Scott gave birth to a baby boy. Scott, who appeared to confirm that she was expecting a son with Cannon on Father’s Day, announced on Saturday that she’s welcomed her baby boy. “I will love you for eternity,” she captioned a trio of black-and-white snaps, two of which showed her cradling the newborn in her arms. Alongside the post she also shared that she welcomed her son on June 23.   A post shared by Alyssa (@itsalyssaemm)  On her Instagram Story she also shared a sweet mother-son photo, which she captioned with the newborn’s name, Zen, alongside a heart emoji. In honor of Father’s Day last month, Scott appeared to share a tribute in honor of Cannon. The model shared a maternity photo, and while Cannon’s face could not be seen completely in the image she shared, the man’s tattoos are noticeably consistent with the Wild ‘N Out star.
