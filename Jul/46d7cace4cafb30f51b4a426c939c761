 [FILES] Pupils enjoying their free meal per day under the Federal Government’s School Feeding Programme.  Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, disclosed this yesterday in Ibadan, Oyo State, saying the enumeration is to ascertain the integrity of its data of nine million pupils getting free meals per day nationwide. The minister said the enumeration of the existing number would be followed by the enrolment of five million more beneficiaries on the school feeding programme. Represented by Director of Finance and Accounts in the ministry, Dr. Matthew Dada, at the flag-off of the exercise in Oyo State, Farouq said the enumeration was in response to the continuous disagreement and questions of some stakeholders about feeding nine million pupils nationwide under the scheme. Farouq also stated that the exercise is to measure the impact of the initiative for better planning and implementation. She said: “We want figures that we are sure to meet all parameters of integrity and that can defend it. At various forums, parliamentarians have asked us the details of these beneficiaries, they have asked us numerous questions because a third party has handled these things. Now, we are making it more inclusive, involving more agencies. If any stakeholders observe that we left out anyone, we will include such person in the next round of enumeration. “Not all stakeholders agree with the data that we have. The data are not enough for analysis and impact assessment purposes. That is why we are improving on the quality of the data and getting more stakeholders involved so that there can be transparency, accountability and integrity of the data so that we can measure the impact of the National Homegrown School Feeding Programme for better planning and implementation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
