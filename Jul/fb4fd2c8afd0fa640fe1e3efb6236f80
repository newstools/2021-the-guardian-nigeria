Khloe Kardashian Bullied For Carrying Daughter, True Khloe Kardashian has been targeted by cruel trolls for simply carrying her daughter True, three, into her dance class in Calabasas. The KUWTK star, who was clad in black gym legging and T-shirt, was pictured last week resting True on her hip as they walked into the dance studio. In light of the photos, mum-shamers took to Twitter to slam the 37-year-old and complained that her daughter should “walk on her own”. One cruel Twitter user penned: “Still won’t let her kid who is dang near 5 feet tall walk on her own.” “Can True not walk? She’s going to be 4,” another shared online. A third posted: “Why isn’t True walking?” Earlier this year, Khloe revealed that online trolling sometimes consume her so much that she has to quit social media. Talking to Cosmopolitan UK, Khloe said she often needs to switch off and focus on the “real world” that her internet fans don’t see. Khloe said: I sometimes like to just take a break and disconnect because none of that actually matters in the real world. I know who I am, and my friends and family know who I am, what my intentions are, and my heart. I’m peaceful with that, so nothing else matters. I’m hugely passionate about health and wellness. I think it’s so important to take care of yourself from the inside out. Staying active and healthy is the best medicine for a happy mind and heart, so I try to do something every day that makes me feel good. Whether it’s a long walk with my mom or sisters or an intense workout, I find it’s so helpful to my mental health to stay active. Now, more than ever, it’s important for each of us to take time to do the things that make our minds and bodies feel good. Khloe was targeted by trolls and body-shamers throughout the show’s 20 seasons, although she admits that people treat her differently now post-weight loss.
