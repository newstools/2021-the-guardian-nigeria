 Dapo Abiodun. Photo/facebook.com/ogsgofficial  The governor’s home council was not also exempted from the hullabaloos, as imposition has become a common song in the area. One of the aspirants, Osularu Olabanjo Muyiwa who was said to have won the Councillorship primaries for Ward 5, Iperu Remo – the governor’s hometown, was allegedly replaced.  The Guardian learnt that the choice candidate — Mr. Stephen Olumuyiwa Eleyowo was replaced by one Mr. Anisere, a legislative aide to the House of Representatives member representing Ifo/Ewekoro, Ibrahim Isiaka.
  
The aggrieved party leaders, through a petition signed by their lawyer, have issued a note of caution to the leadership of the party in the state, to wade into the brewing imposition skirmishes before it dovetails into crisis.
  
According to the petition, during a meeting held at the party secretariat in Arigbajo on May 17, 2021, the party ward leaders nominated Eleyowo as a councillorship candidate for Arigbajo to the dissatisfaction of a party leader, Bamidele Obadina who nominated Anisere.
   
The petition read: “We are also briefed that upon the dissatisfaction of Obadina and his consequent moves to overturn the nomination, the leadership of the party at the council intervened and directed that an election be conducted to determine the candidate, however this process was disrupted when it was found that three of the voters nominated by Obadina were not eligible to vote in that election.
