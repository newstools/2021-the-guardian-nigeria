While Ejiogu and Nwosu were of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the other four were of the ruling party in the state, All Progressive Congress (APC). The Imo Assembly also dissolved all its standing committees as well and also sacked the House Chief Whip, Arthur Egwim (Ideato North) and replaced him with Obinna Okwara (Nkwerre). Announcing the development on the floor of the House on Thursday, Speaker Paul Emeziem said the suspension was to enable the House enjoy relative peace and smooth operation. Emeziem, who said the decision was reached at the executive session of the House, added that his leadership would not condone acts capable of bringing the House to disrepute and ridicule. “We have observed that some members here have been conducting themselves in an unparliamentary manner thereby bringing the house to ridicule,” the speaker said. “We have thoroughly examined this issue at the executive session of the house and have resolved that peace and order must continue to reign. “The executive session has therefore recommended the suspension of the members who have engaged in different misconduct. “This action is in line with ensuring that the image of the house remains as it should be, while providing a functional environment and the synergy which we are required to provide to ensure all arms of government work together.” Meanwhile, there was uproar in the House as the suspension caused controversy among the lawmakers.
There was heavy gunshots by the security personnel within the House complex in an attempt to restore normalcy, following an attempt to attack the speaker. The Speaker and his deputy, Amara Iwuanyanwu were, however, successfully whisked away by their security men. Some of the suspended lawmakers who spoke to newsmen shortly after the House seating said the suspension did not follow due procedure. They described it as illegal and undemocratic, saying that they would challenge their suspension in the court of law in order to seek justice.
