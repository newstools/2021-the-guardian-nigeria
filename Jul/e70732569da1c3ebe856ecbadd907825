The petitioners said: “Whereas local council elections can only be validly held in the recognised 20 local councils in Lagos State, it would amount to a total disregard of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) if the national body of the APC is dealing with Lagos on the grounds of 20 local councils and the Lagos chapter of the party on its own volition is dealing within itself based on 57 local council areas. “If this is allowed without the party at the national level taking urgent steps to correct the anomaly, it might grievously affect and undermine the existence of the political party in the state.” They stated that if the electoral umpire, LAISEC, proceeds with its July 24, 2021 schedule, it would not only violate the core values of the party, but also the relevant section of the nation’s constitution, which recognises only 20 local councils as against the 57 it intended conducting election into. The body reminded the CECPC Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, that it would amount to a “travesty of justice and an act of impunity of the ruling political party at the national level, which usually acts in accordance with the provisions of the constitution in all states of the federation to allow the political party at the state level to behave otherwise.” It, therefore, urged the national headquarters to prevail on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and LAISEC to conduct elections only in the constitutionally recognised 20 local councils to avert unnecessary heating of the polity.
