 Ortom  Ortom, who made the request on Friday during an interactive session with newsmen in Makurdi, said that under no guise should the Act be expunged from the constitution. “There is no basis gagging the press. I completely disagree with those calling for the removal of the press council law in the constitution. “Freedom of Press should be allowed because that is the best way to go. “It gives the oppressed and others the opportunity to express themselves and bring out their challenges to the fore,” the governor said. He further advised those championing the removal of the press council law from the constitution to know they would not be there forever. Otom said he was worried over the situation in the country “because nothing meaningful is happening”.
According to him, Nigerians are suffering and smiling. The governor urged the Federal Government to also approve N100 billion for ranching in Benue, since it approved N6.5 billion for ranching in Katsina State. He said his request was based on the fact that Benue was the first to champion the call for the establishment of ranching and prohibition of open grazing.
