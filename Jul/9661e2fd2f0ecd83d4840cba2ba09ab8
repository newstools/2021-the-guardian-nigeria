The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed the physical registration of voters earlier scheduled to commence on July 19, 2020. INEC National Commissioner & Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said on Friday that the postponement became necessary due to the forthcoming public holiday. He said the physical registration of voters would now commence on Monday, July 26, 2021. Okoye explained that the exercise might be affected by the declaration of Tuesday 20, and Wednesday 21, July 2021, as public holidays by the Federal Government. He said online registrants who had scheduled appointments from July 19 to July 23, 2021, would have their appointments rescheduled. He said, “The commission met yesterday July 15, 2021, and deliberated on a number of issues including the commencement of the physical registration of voters and the scheduled appointments by online registrants. “It will be recalled that on Tuesday, July 13, 2021, the Commission met with Resident Electoral Commissioners and noted that the commencement of physical registration of voters scheduled for July 19, 2021 might be affected by public holidays,” Okoye said. “Also facing prospect of interruption of their registration schedules are some of the online registrants who have scheduled their appointments for the completion of their registrations on dates likely to clash with the same public holidays. “The Commission promised thereafter to meet on Thursday  July 15, 2021 to review the situation and provide clarity on the matter. This is what it has done. “It is important to emphasise that this Continuous Voter Registration will take place over a period of one year. The Commission assures all Nigerians that no citizen eligible to register as a voter will be left behind.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
