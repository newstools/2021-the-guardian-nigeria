Amike, a former African champion in 400 meters hurdles, said the performance of the athletes during the trials convinced him that they were ready. “They have all peaked at the time that it matters most, peaking at the right time, I am confident that they will do well. “I believe they have done their part, training for an event as huge as the Olympics is not easy, I hope they have a fabulous outing. “Judging from how impressive they were at the trials, I am optimistic about their performance,” he said. When asked about the events in which he hoped the athletes would win medals, he said all the athletes had the potential to pick a medal at the Olympics. “Qualifying for the games alone is a big deal, but I think the most important thing is to qualify for the finals, when they make it to the finals then anything can happen. “Then if you look at our basketball team, D’Tigers, their recent victories, causing upsets, I believe if they can improve on it, we will have a good outing in Tokyo better than we did in Brazil,” Amike said. NAN reports that Nigeria left 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics with only a bronze medal won by the men’s football squad, scoring 3–2 against Hondurans.
