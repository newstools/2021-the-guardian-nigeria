However, when his search for the truth leads to a deadly encounter that puts Ray and his daughter Rachel (Merced) in harm’s way, Ray’s mission turns into a quest for vengeance in order to protect the only family he has left. Brian Andrew Mendoza is in the director’s chair here, and the cast also includes Justin Bartha, Amy Brenneman, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. Watch below:
