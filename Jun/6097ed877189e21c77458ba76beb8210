A Lagos-based disabilities rights advocate group,  the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD), yesterday, said it lost a voice for persons with disabilities with the passing of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua at the age of 57. The group, in a statement by its Executive Director, David Anyaele, said the popular televangelist and founder of Emmanuel Television and Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) was a man of purpose. According to him, the late prophet used his time and resources for the good of vulnerable people and was a strong supporter of humanitarian and human rights activities across the world. “TB Joshua was one of the few general overseers of churches in Nigeria that does not discriminate nor stigmatise on the grounds of disability.
“He used his wealth and connections to support the poor and needy, especially persons with disabilities. Be it on his birthday, special occasions or even Christmas, he not only invited citizens with disabilities, he personally made sure they are not left out in the distribution of food and other materials.
“It is also on record that TB Joshua supported persons with disabilities that are into sporting activities, as he sponsored many to international competitions. “The death of TB Joshua has created a big challenge to many families that rely on his philanthropic gesture for survival. Now that TB Joshua is no more, who will fill this gap? “While we commiserate with his family, his church, and multitude of his followers, it is our prayer that the good Lord will grant all the fortitude to accept what we cannot change,” the statement added. Similarly, the Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in Ondo State said it received with bewilderment the death of TB Joshua, who was also a son of Ondo State. The group, in a statement signed by its media and publicity secretary, Comrade Ikuomola Olubadewa Pedro, said they had no words to describe their anguish over the sudden departure of such a great man of God whose ministry and callings immensely impacted on this generation and even generations to come. “There is no basis for argument that Pastor Joshua used his ministry to depopulate the kingdom of the devil, straightened lives that would have failed to manifest destinies and redirected steps of many who hitherto were on their way to perdition, to the kingdom of God. “For these reasons, we are doubly sure that he is now being welcomed into the joy of his Father in heaven. Hallelujah! The Holy Bible through Paul the Apostle, has taught hope that we all shall meet on the resurrection morning when we shall part no more. “The PWDs in Ondo State and Nigeria at large commiserate with the immediate family of the departed soul, the traditional ruler of Arigidi-Akoko, Oba Yisa Olanipekun and the entire Arigidi-Akoko community over the loss of this illustrious son who once bestrode the religious firmament like a colossus and whose positive footprints will be difficult to erase in the annals of history,” it added.
