Soyinka Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has denounced a post credited to him on WhatsApp, associating him with the agitation for a Yoruba Nation, describing the post as “fake” and a “misinformation.” In a statement by his spokesperson, Abiola Owoaje, Soyinka urged the public to ignore the utterances of “those contemptible interlopers that lack the courage of their conviction and thus take to identity theft for the furtherance of their views.” Soyinka reiterated that he does not participate in Facebook, Tweet, Blog, WhatsApp and others, stressing that any view that he wishes to express on national and other issues were routinely done through the print media.
