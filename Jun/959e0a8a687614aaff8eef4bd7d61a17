For the first time since its launch on April 22, 2013 by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), telecommunications operators in the country conducted no porting activities in the first three months of the year.
 
Statistics from the NCC showed that the quartet of MTN, Globacom, Airtel and 9mobile recorded zero number porting activities from January to March on both incoming and outgoing platforms. This is not unconnected to the SIM-NIN policy that was enforced by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami.
 
Speaking on the development, the Nigeria Coordinator, Alliance of Affordable Internet (A4AI), Olusola Teniola, said: “It appears that MNP requires a new SIM to be issued during the porting process. This new SIM requires a NIN to be associated with it and in Q1, operators were not issuing new SIMs due to FG’s ban being in place.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
