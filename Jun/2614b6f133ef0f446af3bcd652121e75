The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State, Mr. Latep Dabang, has been suspended for alleged anti-party activities. The National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this in a statement, yesterday, in Jos. The statement revealed that  the chairman’s suspension was contained in a document endorsed by a good number of members of the state executive committee, which has Governor Simon Lalong as a member; hence cannot be ignored. “In line with this, therefore, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State has authorised the constitution of a three-man fact-finding committee to look into the allegations with a view to determining the veracity of the claims. In line with the mandate of transparency of the CECPC, Dabang was, therefore, advised to step aside from his position as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of APC in the state. The Deputy state caretaker chairman is to act as the state caretaker chairman pending the conclusion of the findings of the committee,” it stated. The committee members assured the party faithful and citizens of Plateau of fairness and good conscience in the assignment given to them.
