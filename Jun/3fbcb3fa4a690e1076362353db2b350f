• Buni cautions youths against ‘treacherous elements’ Angry youths in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), yesterday, staged a protest against insecurity and bad governance. They blocked the popular Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Airport Road causing heavy gridlock and set up bonfires. A video clip online showed some of the protesters regretting they couldn’t even afford fuel to burn tyres, a veiled reference to how Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) had increased from N87 to N160 under the Buhari government. The protesters chanted songs with lines that asked why many people were dying like flies in a democratic government. They also called for an end to insecurity, corruption, impunity, and a reversal of the suspension of Twitter. Security operatives later cleared the road, restoring free flow of traffic and normalcy to the area. This came as President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his resolve to deal with troublemakers in the country. Speaking at the first Progressives Youth Conference in Abuja, he expressed satisfaction with improvement recorded on the nation’s security. Represented by Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, he said: “We are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them. “As I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly. I am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we will keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements.” Also, Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee Mai Mala Buni told the participants: “As the most energetic segment of the population, retrogressive elements with evil interests in causing confusion, creating and fanning hate and disunity will always rely on you to achieve such negative and unpatriotic tendencies and to destroy your future. You must resist them. You should never allow yourselves to be used as tools in the hands of these treacherous elements.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
