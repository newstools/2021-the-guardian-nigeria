Association also suspended Blessing. TAMPAN’s action has since elicited a wave of reactions from entertainers and the general public alike, including the IWIF which has condemned the ban in its entirety. IWIF described the action as unjust and smack of selective justice. Speaking in the same vein of disappointment at the TAMPAN ban, Convener of IWIF, Zulumoke Oyibo also took to her personal Instagram page to dissect the issue. “So two actors, Iyabo Ojo (f) and Yomi Fabiyi (m) were involved in a number of heated public exchanges over the actions of…Baba Ijesha,” Oyibo said. “TAMPAN, in all its beautiful wisdom, decides to ban Iyabo Ojo (f) for her conduct. “In case you are wondering, (f) stands for female.” Oyibo also highlighted how Fabiyi who had been at loggerheads with Iyabo Ojo from the outset of the Baba Ijesha arrest, was spared from the association’s action sanctions despite openly using derogatory comments. “Let’s not have a conversation on whether TAMPAN is wrong or wrong. Let’s just assume their decision is very not wrong. Yet. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO YOMI FABIYI, not a blacklist nor a ban.” Oyibo said. IWIF also reiterated its commitment to “tackling social, ethical, and professional challenges women in film face, while promoting a work environment that is safe and free for everyone.”
