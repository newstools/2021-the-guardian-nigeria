 Ahmad Lawan: Photo Twitter  After the conclusion of part one of the 2015 Office of the Auditor General’s report scheduled, it was for consideration yesterday but deferred the deliberation until further notice. In the report, recommendations for consideration and Senate’s approval for 59 MDAs had their queries sustained In summation of the report, the Senate Public Accounts Committee, headed by Mathew Urhoghide, cleared 46 agencies, having invited all queried MDAs, of which 84 submitted their responses and appeared before the committee to defend the reservations raised against them. The report revealed that 21 MDAs sent written responses to the committee, but did not appear at the hearing, while seven MDAs neither made submissions nor appeared before the committee. The report further stated that two of the MDAs reported to the committee that either Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC or Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) or both were in possession of the original copies of their documents, and therefore, could not respond or appear before the committee.
