President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, pledged to bequeath “a citizen-led policing system’” to Nigeria, declaring that his administration had demonstrated firm commitment towards changing police’s operations in the country. Addressing the passing-out parade of 418 officers of the third Regular Cadet Course at the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State, the President directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to review upward the emoluments of personnel. Represented by the Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, the President said a citizen-led policing arrangement informed the approval of community policing as part of  the country’s internal security strategy and the resultant funds’ approval to accomplish the implementation. On the revised salary and allowances for the force, he said it would be commensurate with the vital functions it performs as the lead agency in internal security architecture. Buhari noted that the police reforms embarked upon by his administration had focused on improving the welfare of the force by way of recruitment of 10,000 junior police officers yearly and investing in the upgrade of facilities at the police academy and training institutions across the federation. He said: “In addition, a Nigeria Police Academy (Establishment) Bill is currently receiving legislative attention at the National Assembly. On passage, the bill will give full legal backing to the existence and academic programmes of the Nigeria Police Academy and fully legitimise its status as a police university. “Furthermore, as part of our police reform initiatives, the Police Public Complaint Committee (PCC), which is domiciled in the Ministry of Police Affairs, has been resuscitated with the mandate to receive complaints from the public on cases of abuse and maltreatment by police officers.  The PPCC has a membership made up of officials from relevant MDAs and security agencies.” The President continued: “A Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement undertaken by the Ministry of Police Affairs to rejuvenate the National Public Security Communication System Network has been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). “This is with a view to ensuring that when fully reactivated the police and other security agencies will be able to fully utilise this vital facility.” Buhari’s address highlighted “well thought-out reform programmes” by his administration to modernise and reposition the police to meet the aspirations of the citizens, as well as to manage current and evolving threats in the most efficient and professional manner. “We re-established the Ministry of Police Affairs out of the former Ministry of Interior in 2019. This is with the intention to drive the police reform process by initiating, formulating and implementing policies and programmes relating to policing and internal security. “This initiative was also intended to provide supervision and administrative support to the force, particularly in the area of training and capacity development, as well as the enhancement of the budgetary profile of the Nigeria Police Force,” he added.
