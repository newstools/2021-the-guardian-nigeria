Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd), has disagreed with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and some House of Representatives members over legalisation of cannabis. Akeredolu had urged the Federal Government to jettison traditional orientation and “archaic” sentiment that said that cannabis is a ‘devil’s plant.’ The governor, had at a stakeholders’ roundtable on the “benefits and opportunities of cannabis plant in Nigeria” recently, urged the Federal Government to give legal backing to cannabis to enable its use in the country, saying that “cannabis is a multi-billion naira industry that can help diversify the Nigerian economy if judiciously utilised.” The National Assembly had also been making moves for legalisation of the illicit substance under the guise of its economic value. Marwa, who spoke at a press briefing to unveil the week-long programme of activities in commemoration of the United Nations (UN) International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking in Abuja, yesterday, said it was a matter of life and money, adding that it is like seeing fire and plunging into the flame. He said the agency would rather choose life. “The NDLEA will continue to burn any farm that we find the substance and arrest the perpetrators. “It is dangerous. It is bad for our health.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
