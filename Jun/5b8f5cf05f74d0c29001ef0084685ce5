Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, had assigned the case to Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo for adjudication. Aside Buhari, other defendants in the suit with reference number, FHC/ABJ/CS/480/2021, are the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
