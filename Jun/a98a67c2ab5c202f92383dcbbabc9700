Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, yesterday, accused the opposition in the state of politicising insecurity and rubbishing the security architecture to gain prominence. Makinde stated this during the inauguration of Oyo State Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps Governing Board at the Executive Council Chamber of the Governor’s Office, Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, the state capital. The governor maintained that security is a collective responsibility, not just for the government or governor alone, adding that everybody needs to come on board and part-take. The governor, who bemoaned the security challenges in the country, said one of the reasons for the establishment of the Amotekun corps was to bring security operatives closer to the people. He said: “Amotekun Corps are not licensed to carry weapons like AK-47 compared with the sophisticated weapons being carried by the bandits. “We believe that with the inauguration of this board today, we will see even more visible action in securing Oyo State, especially in the area of fostering relationship between Amotekun of Oyo State and similar security network agencies in the neighbouring states of Ondo, Osun and Ekiti. “We also expect more inter-agency co-operation within the state. “I have been listening and watching people trying to politicise the issue of security. Well, I want to appeal to such individuals within the state. It is our state and it is only God that puts people in position.” If you want to destroy the state before everybody to gain political power, I wonder the kind of state such an individual or group of people will want to preside over. We have seen cases where they doctor videos to discredit Amotekun. We have seen cases where people go out and out-rightly tell lies. “Now, everybody has been on the streets as an advisor on security. They have all sorts of advice they gave to me and I asked them where they practise their own security. They have not gone beyond their streets and maybe they organise Neighbourhood Watch and they think that it is the qualification on how to advise us on the issue of security.” Makinde, therefore, vowed to continue to take the issue of security of life and property and people being able to go about their lawful endeavours in Oyo State seriously. He said that inaugurating the board became imperative in a bid to expand the state’s security architecture and improve its system, which he said, was in fulfilment of the law setting up the Amotekun Corps.
