The prosecution of the alleged killer of Miss Inibong Umoren, a job seeker, murdered in Akwa Ibom State, will commence soon.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Odiko Macdon, disclosed this yesterday while giving an update on the matter in Uyo. He said all was set to prosecute Uduak Akpan, the murder suspect, who allegedly raped and killed the job seeker.
   
According to him, with the autopsy result of the deceased, the police has got what it takes to prosecute the murderer.	While denying claims that the case had been taken over by the Department of State Security, Macdon stated that only the police were empowered by law to handle such cases.
 
He explained that Akpan, alongside the soldier who murdered one Enobong Jimmy, and the church founder, Ukachukwu Christopher, who beat his wife to death, had been officially remanded in the Nigeria Correctional Service, and would be arraigned in court soon.
  
“Autopsy on the corpse of Inibong Umoren has been conducted. The result is out. We now have what it takes to nail Frank. It was very painful for people to say the police didn’t do a nice job.
  
“We worked with the DPP to get those people remanded in the Nigeria Correctional Service even before the court resumed. They will be arraigned. We have sent the case files of Uduak Frank, the soldier who murdered one Enobong Jimmy, and the church founder, Ukachukwu Christopher, who beat his wife to death to DPP and we are waiting for them.
 
“Let me assure you that the command will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all those cases are prosecuted logically because we have carried out the autopsies and have the result. We have the suspects in custody, we have the legal teams ready, and we have a robust relationship with the justice department because we are all ministers in the temple of justice,” he said.
