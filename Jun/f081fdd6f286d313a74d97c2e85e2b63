 [FILES] Emmanuel Macron  As former French president, François Mitterrand, had noted in 1957: “Without Africa, France will no longer have a history in the twenty-first century.” France has therefore continued a neo-colonial relationship with the continent. Pax Gallica established military bases across Africa, and like a “pyromaniac fireman” intervened over 50 times to prop up or depose assorted tyrants. An unequal system of Françafrique saw 14 largely francophone African states tie their currencies to the French franc, and now the euro.  Macron in Africa 
Macron visited Rwanda and South Africa in the last week. France had trained and armed the genocidal Hutu-led militias before the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which about 800,000 people were killed. Macron’s visit to Kigali thus resulted in him asking for forgiveness for France’s sordid role while stopping short of a full apology. Engaging in sophistry, the French leader noted that his country bore “serious and overwhelming responsibility” for the genocide, but then astonishingly argued that it had not been complicit in the massacres. The French intervention in Rwanda had, in fact, facilitated the génocidaires’ escape into eastern Congo.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
