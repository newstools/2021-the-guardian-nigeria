• Sub-Saharan Africa has worst mobile gender gap The wide gender gap continues to reduce women’s contribution to the global economy as there are still some 74 million unconnected women in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). 13 per cent of them are unlikely to own a mobile phone than men in the region.
   
The GSMA’s 2021 Mobile Gender Gap Report, which revealed this, showed that the mobile ownership rate for women in sub-Saharan Africa was 75 per cent in 2020, compared to 82 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and 83 per cent for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in general.
   
The report noted that overall for LMICs, the mobile gender gap shrunk over the past year, to 15 per cent from 19 per cent a year ago, despite the onset of COVID-19.  For the first time since 2017, the gender gap in smartphone ownership has reduced across LMICs. In 2019, women were 20 per cent less likely to own a smartphone, but this dropped to 15 per cent in 2020.
   
According to GSMA, women and men who own a smartphone are also much more likely to be aware of mobile Internet and to use it than those who own a basic or feature phone. For example, in Nigeria, 93 per cent of female smartphone owners use mobile Internet, compared to only 12 per cent of women who own a feature phone.
   
The GSMA report found that when women own a smartphone, their adoption of mobile Internet and the range of mobile services they use is almost on par with male smartphone owners.
   
Findings from the report are based on results from over 9,000 face-to-face surveys across eight low- and middle-income countries, and subsequent modeling and analysis of the data. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
