Otunba Ademola Popoola has donated a trophy for a football competition, which he said, would engage Ekiti youths positively and build their capacity through sports. The competition will involve clubs from the 16 local councils in Ekiti State. While unveiling the event slated to begin to commence this month and end by the last week of July, he commended the leadership of Ekiti Football Association for developing grassroots football, adding that the competition would further complement their efforts in that area. “The aims of putting this competition together are to identify talented soccer players among our youths in Ekiti and develop them into finished products, thereby creating an opportunity for the Ekiti youths to make a good living out of the round leather game, which has become a money-spinning venture globally,” he said. Otunba Popoola added, “I know there are many untapped talents in Ekiti, which this competition will bring out… that is my major focus. I will be able to develop brains and nurture talents, if you have skills or talents and there’s no way to showcase it, one can die with such qualities.” Also speaking at the event, Chairman, Ekiti State Football Association, Bayo Kehinde-Olanlege, endorsed the tournament via a letter of authorisation issued to acknowledge the tournament. He charged other well-meaning personalities from Ekiti State to emulate the gesture by Otunba Popoola by collaborating with the FA to develop Ekiti football. Participants are expected to win mouth-watering cash prizes and medals according to the chairman of the Main Organizing Committee (MOC) of the tournament, Otunba Femi Arowosola, while individual honours such as the most valuable player, best goalkeeper and highest goal scorer will also be rewarded.
