 Udeogaranya  Speaking in a telephone interview with The Guardian, yesterday, Udeogaranya noted the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor was the best among all those jostling for the post, saying the good people of Anambra State should ensure that he emerges successful at the poll. He said: “The former CBN governor, Charles Soludo, remain the best candidate for the job and therefore, there is no need to bother with the rest when the best has emerged. “Being a state governor with the prevailing circumstances of direct funding of local councils from source, huge state debts, COVID-19 paralysed global economy, ever increasing foreign exchange rate in a state that harbours greatest number of Nigerian importers, dangerous insecurity challenges, unprecedented restiveness among the youth and outrageous unemployment rates would not be a child’s play.” Udeogaranya appealed for a nonpartisan approach to the election, adding:  “I am not a member of APGA but achieving a better Anambra State, a better Igboland and a better Nigeria, remains a task for all. In the end, good governance for the people should be victorious and not ones political party.” To other aspirants across the political parties, Udeogaranya said: “A better Anambra State should be victorious than an individual political success and all hands should put hands on deck to make it happen.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
