 [FILES] Mechanic at work PHOTO: Seun O<br />  The group, in the petition obtained by The Guardian, raised the alarm that the mechanic clusters duly allotted to them by the Lagos State Government under the Lateef Jakande administration are currently being taken over by various agents of the state government. In the petition, they demanded the return of all mechanic villages duly allotted to mechanics. They called for the immediate removal of Toyin Fayinka, whose activities, they alleged as the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Transportation bordered on impunity. The group demanded the construction of more mechanic work clusters across the state to take care of the needs of Lagosians for the services of skilled technicians and as means of employment for newly trained mechanics and auto technicians. The workers had last week protested against the illegal takeover of their workshops, otherwise known as mechanic villages by the state government.  “The time it was given to us, most of those areas were swampy, but we developed, maintained and made them habitable for our work. Now, the Ministry of Physical Planning through Hon. Toyin Fayinka, S.A to the governor on Transport has taken over, demolishing our workshops and selling the places to highest bidders.”

When our villages were destroyed they took vehicles of our customers away and we were forced to pay N100,000 on each of the vehicles before they were released, you can understand our predicaments.”  “Justice shall be done to your petition. The House is well represented and we are here as your representatives,” the lawmakers assured.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
