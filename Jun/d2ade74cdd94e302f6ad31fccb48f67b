The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) halted three consecutive days of losses to close in an upbeat yesterday, as investors’ wealth increased by N78 billion. At the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 149.89 absolute points, representing a growth of 0.40 per cent to close at 37,954.35 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation value gained N78 billion to close at N19.781 trillion. The upturn was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; BUA Cement, Nigerian Breweries, Guaranty Trust Bank Holdings Company, Eterna and Zenith Bank. Capital market analysts said that the bullish sentiment was due to investors’ bargain hunting in virtually all the sectors, except the Insurance sector. Analysts at Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “While the market was in a positive swing today, activity levels remained subdued. Thus, we expect the market to end the week on a mixed note, as investors continue to buy up beaten-down names and take profit on some counters.” On the price movement chart, 20 stocks appreciated in price, while 14 others constituted the losers’ chart.
