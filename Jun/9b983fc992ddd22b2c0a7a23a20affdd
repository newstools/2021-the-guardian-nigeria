 Princess Aderemi Adebowale  She said human faeces contain bacteria and germs, which consequently contaminate the sources of water people drink or use for many other purposes. Adebowale, who stated this yesterday during a sensitisation programme against open defecation in Lagos State, held at Ajeromi Ifelodun local council, said open defecation was a public menace that requires urgent attention, noting that it could easily lead to outbreak of communicable diseases such as cholera, typhoid, diarrhoea and other gastro-intestinal infections. According to her, it was estimated that 46 million people practice open defecation in Nigeria, thereby putting the country among countries with the highest number of people practicing open defecation. She stressed that the practice of open defecation has a negative effect on the populace, especially children, in the areas of health, environment and education. “This programme is coming on the heels of environmental and health hazards that open defecation poses to our people in the state.  As you may be aware, open defecation refers to the practice of defecating in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces. “This sensitisation is to ensure Lagosians join the global crusade, spread the awareness, inspire environmental-friendly actions and support in facilitating the provision of sustainable sanitation practices capable of promoting economic growth and well-being of the citizenry,” she said.
