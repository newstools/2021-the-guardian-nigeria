Gombe State Government has revoked land titles in the state’s metropolis to allow for new developmental layouts. Consequently, it advised all land and structure owners to approach Gombe Geographical Information System (GOGIS) to re-certify their properties. The Deputy Governor, Manassah Jattau, who disclosed this to the media yesterday in his office, said the new layout would afford the state a befitting secretariat, high court complex, new House of Assembly complex and others. The exercise is christened ‘Gombe Capital Special Development Zone’. Jatau said: “As a caring and concerned government, Governor Yahaya has approved a new Land Administration Policy to take care of infrastructural and socio-economic development of the state. Based on powers vested in him as enshrined in the Land Use Act 1978, all land titles at the location within Gombe metropolis have been revoked for overriding public interest.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
