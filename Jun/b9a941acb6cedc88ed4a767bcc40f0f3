The unnamed woman contacted police to admit to her assault and the slice victim was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation so medics could attempt to reattach his penis. It was not immediately clear this morning if the operation had been a success. The woman, described as a Bangladeshi national in her thirties, is being held at a nearby police station following her early-hours arrest. Detectives have opened an investigation into her claims she was acting in self-defense and have not ruled out the arrest of the bar owner once he is well enough to be quizzed. Well-placed police sources said the woman had told them she had been harassed for months and had been forced to have sex on several occasions by her boss before she assaulted him with a knife during a new ‘rape attempt’ late on Monday. A spokesman for the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force confirmed on Tuesday: “A woman has been arrested for a crime of wounding following an incident around midnight at a bar in Sant Andreu de la Barca. The arrest happened in the early hours of this morning.” A source added: “The woman was the one who contacted police to explain what had happened. She said she had cut off her boss’s penis as he tried to sexually assault her. Her claims are being investigated and the bar owner may be arrested once the hospital say he is well enough to be questioned.” The emergency operation was due to take place at Bellvitge Hospital, a public hospital in the town of l’Hospitalet de Llobregrat. The man’s nationality has not been officially revealed, although he is also thought to be from Bangladesh or Pakistan.
