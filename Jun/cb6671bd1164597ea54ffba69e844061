 National Assembly (NASS)  In a judgment delivered in the suit filed by Ubani at the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos earlier this month, the court held that RMAFC and not the National Assembly Service Commission has the right to fix the salaries of members. The court also directed RMAFC to commence a downward review of members’ salaries and remuneration to reflect the present economic realities in the country. In a letter dated June 21, 2021, Ubani, who is the chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), drew the attention of the AGF to the judgment and urged him to immediately direct RMAFC, National Assembly Service Commission (NASC), the Senate and House of Representation to comply with the court’s decision.
