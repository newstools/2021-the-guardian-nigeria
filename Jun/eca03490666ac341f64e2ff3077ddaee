 1999 Constitution.  The 1999 Constitution isn’t in conformity with the 1963 Federal Constitution we inherited from our colonial master, the British Government. Although our name is the Federation of Nigeria and the federal government is the government of the Federation, the 1999 Constitution does not uphold the federal character of the republic of Nigeria. If this Constitution were federal, the Federal Government would not be controlling the police, oil and minerals exclusively. Like in the 1963 Constitution, the regions would be in control of their own resources. They would have regional or local government police. Certainly the British bequeathed to us a vibrant and workable federal system of government. Sadly, this Constitution has foisted us ethnic domination, and leaders without vision which has stagnated our economic progress and prosperity. But errors like this are not strange. They can be rectified. Such was the situation in the United States between 1787 and 1788 when their system of Confederation wasn’t working. The papers put forward then is referred to today as the Federalist Papers. Those papers persuaded Americans to adopt a federalist constitution for America. The Americans eventually ratified the current federal system of government in the country. The federal choice by the Americans more than 230 years ago is the success song on every lip in the world today.
 
It suffices to say, what America is today is the result of profound changes, amendments and political engineering that took blood via the civil war, tears and sacrifices.  Nigeria is overcrowding the democracy highway we’re walking in. And the way is developing bump, manholes and craters and these problems are crying for solution.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
