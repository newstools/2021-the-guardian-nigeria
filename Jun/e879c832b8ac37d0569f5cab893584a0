The docu-series mirrors cooking competition on global food channels by showcasing the best street delicacies through the culinary prowess of 13 contestants, who slugged it out for 12 weeks, evading elimination stages and progressing to the finale.
  
Held at the Alao Aka-Bashorun Park, Gbagada, Lagos, the grand finale of the cooking competition by FoodBay TV, a part of Maxima Media Group, was spiced with live music performance before the stage was eventually set for the final battle.  “Food Bay has one mission: to put African food – not just Nigerian food – on the world food map. We started this journey about three to four years ago, building content that cut across different segments within the culinary space.
  
“We decided to do this because we saw that gap within that space. If you check within the food media, we pretty much have two giants within that space: BBC Lifestyle and Food Network. There is no platform big enough or bold enough to be able to take the African story, when it comes to food, to the rest of the world,” Ogundoro concluded.
