Vice Chancellor, Prof Charles Igwe, who disclosed this at a press conference in Enugu as part of activities to mark its 49th convocation, said the institution, during the period, produced its own sanitisers, a contactless digital machine that performed the tripartite function of hand sanitising, washing and temperature monitoring. “We upgraded our Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, acquired necessary software licenses, trained our staff and quickly adjusted to blended teaching. This gave us the opportunity to combine virtual and classroom contacts, while members of staff continued to participate in countless academic activities, including meetings, international conferences and examinations,” he said. Igwe stated that 95 per cent of programmes and departments of the institution were accredited by National Universities Commission (NUC). He revealed that 11, 010 graduating students would receive first degree and diploma certificates, out of which 186 would be awarded first class. He said 4,048 would be awarded second class honours (lower division), 1,101 third class, while 79 others would be awarded Pass degree. Another 408 graduates would earn “unclassified” degrees, one distinction, 23 credits, 39 merits and seven passes. The UNN boss added that Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, would give the convocation lecture titled: “Economic justice and national security: Conquering insecurity through combating poverty.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
