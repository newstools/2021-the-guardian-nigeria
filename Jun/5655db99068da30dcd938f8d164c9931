The judge, Oluwatoyin Taiwo, granted the Baba Ijesha bail in the sum of N2 million. The actor was arraigned before the Special Offences Court in Lagos on charges of sexual assault, indecent treatment of a child, and sexual assault by penetration. Taiwo said bail is a constitutional right and not a discretionary right. Baba Ijesha was arrested and detained by the Lagos state police after he was alleged to have sexually molested a minor at age 7 and 14. He was first granted bail on May 17 — after spending about 25 days in police detention — by magistrates in charge of prison decongestion. But he was remanded in police custody despite the bail.
