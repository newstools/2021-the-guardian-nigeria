Agba said that implementation of the second NAP scheduled to end in 2021, was extended by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that the pandemic slowed down the implementation and government decided to extend it by one year during the international steering committee meeting. Dr Anne Nzegwu, National Coordinator, Open Government Partnership (OGP), said that the second NAP has 16 commitments in seven thematic areas. Nzegwu said the thematic areas include; Fiscal Transparency, Extractive Transparency, Anti-corruption, Access to Information, Citizens Engagement, Inclusion, Diversity and Service Delivery. “We are here today to strengthen implementation of the second NAP for better and reaching progress with its implementation beyond the outcome of the implementation of the first NAP as reported by Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM),’’ she said. The OGP coordinator said that the pandemic affected time and ability of the working group to meet as they would have preferred. “I believe that with the extension of the implementation cycle of the second NAP to August 2022, seeing that we have a year to the deadline, we will hit the ground running. “The goal is to gain better results towards the assessment of the second NAP by the IRM,” she said. Nzegwu further said that the secretariat was ready to work with the group for a better outcome; the aim was for the assessment of the performance by the IRM. She added that they had also developed monitoring and evaluation framework circulated to thematic Co-Chairs, which would aid in tracking and measuring activities in the action plan.
