It said no other players in the squad had tested positive for the virus. Vidal was initially hospitalized with severe tonsilitis, but tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, the team statement said. The former Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus star, who was vaccinated against the virus on Friday, will now miss the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier with Argentina and another qualifier against Bolivia next week in Santiago. Covid-19 infections in Chile remain above 6,000 daily cases and the health system is overwhelmed. The virus has killed more than 29,000 people out of a total 1.3 million cases in the country.
