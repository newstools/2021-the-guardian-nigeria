In a chat with The Guardian yesterday, the Ezinifite, Nnewi South Local Council-born chartered accountant listed the main problems to include healthcare, security, education, infrastructure and trade. He said his all-inclusive manifesto would also address necessary catalysts for growth such as women and youth empowerment, effective local government administration, social welfare, among others. The Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) accounting graduate relished his deep involvement in philanthropic and humanitarian activities. On how he plans to develop the South East state, the Master’s degree holder in same course from same ivory tower pledged a robust relationship with the grassroots with a view to getting first-hand information on the goings in every part of the state and work deeply with the police and vigilantes for safety of lives and property. Security, the 40-year-old stressed, was key in his bid to sell Anambra to the world as a viable investment destination. Assuring the people that he would work closely with the government at the centre to ensure that the state gets its fair share of deal if elected into office, the LP flag-bearer harped on infrastructure development, reiterating that new roads would be built and existing ones maintained. Same attention, he added, would be accorded to hospitals. He said: “I plan to develop Anambra into a world-class state. Anambra has human and non-human resources in abundance. I would effectively harness all the state’s resources to create a well-structured entity with strong institutions. A state where its citizens and residents would enjoy a very high standard of living that would be the envy of the entire nation. “I would bring government closer to the people by ensuring a viable local government administration in my tenure. All local government executives would have direct access to me. I would ensure that they help me fulfill my election promises to the citizens in their constituents.” The philanthropist continued: “I would reach out to all men and women of repute in the state, seeking their cooperation in selling the state to the world as a viable investment destination.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
