• APC urges talented Nigerians to develop homegrown alternatives Despite widespread anger over the ban on Twitter use in the country, indications emerged, yesterday, that the Federal Government is not ready to shift grounds.  MEANWHILE, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has ordered the immediate probe of the decision by the Federal Government to ban the usage of Twitter in the country. The decision by the Speaker did not go down well with members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who insisted on the immediate reversal of the ban pending the outcome of an investigation.
 
Speaking during the plenary of the House, Gbajabiamila directed the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to brief the House on the objectives, intent, and duration of the suspension on the operations of Twitter in the country. The Minister is billed to appear before the House Committees on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence chamber within 10 days to clear the air on the matter.  IN defiance of the government’s ban, many leaders of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and other stakeholders have declared their resolve to keep on tweeting, while damning the consequences. According to the CSOs in a statement, yesterday, the recent declaration by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to arrest anyone, who convey messages through Twitter would not deter them.
 
No fewer than 40 signatories signed the statement, challenging the Federal Government’s action to ban Twitter in the country. Among them are Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director, Paradigm Initiative (PIN); ‘Yemi Adamolekun, Executive Director, EiE Nigeria; Cynthia Mbamalu, Director of Programmes, Yiaga Africa; Hamzat Lawal, Connected Development (CODE)/Follow The Money; Joshua Olufemi, Founder, Dataphyte; Idayat Hassan, Executive Director, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD); Kolawole Oluwadare, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP); Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Center (CISLAC), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani; and Executive Director, Media Rights Agenda (MRA), Edeatan Ojo.
 
They said that as practitioners, there is no recongnised law across the globe that could ban citizens from accessing information and sharing the same for the best interest of society.  In the suit number ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed yesterday before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP is seeking an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.
 
In the suit filed by a solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana (SAN), the plaintiffs contend that “if this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
