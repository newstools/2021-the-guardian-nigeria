Protesters are currently blocking the Umaru Yarâ€™Adua Way leading to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The youths are protesting under the aegis of #RevolutionNow. They made bonfires on the ever-busy road, leaving motorists and commuters stranded. Most affected are workers who live in Lugbe, Kuje, and other areas along the Airport road axis, who are finding their way to the city centre to resume work after the weekend. Operatives of the FCT police command have been deployed to check the situation.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
