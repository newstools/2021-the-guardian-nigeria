Jude Ilo training for July 1st elimination fight against Jekwo Williams Africa’S light heavyweight boxing champion, Jude llo, is set for a battle with Jekwo Williams in a World Boxing Organistion (WBO) title elimination bout, on July 1 at the National Stadium, Lagos. Ilo, who said at the weekend in Lagos that he has been working hard for chance to fight for the WBO title, believes the fight with Williams will give him opportunity to challenge Mexico’s Saul Alvarez for the WBO title in the U.S. later this year. “I am training hard to battle with Jekwo Williams successfully. When I win the fight, I will also meet with another boxer before I qualify to fight WBO Super Middleweight champion, Soul Alvarez, also known as Canelo, from Mexico in a world title fight in December. “My mission is to beat all my opponents to represent Nigeria at the world scene. I have watched Jekwo’s tapes and I am optimistic that bringing him down will not be a problem. “In my boxing career, I have fought 11 fights and excelled in most of them. So, contending for a place in the world title will not pose any problem to me. All I need is the prayers and full support of Nigerians,” he said. Ilo called on government and private individuals to encourage young boxers at the grassroots by providing enabling environment for them, stressing that boxing has been a major business in America because of much awareness and encouragement given to young aspiring talents in boxing.
