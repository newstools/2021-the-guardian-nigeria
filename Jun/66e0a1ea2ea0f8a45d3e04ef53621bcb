thus take to identity theft for the furtherance of their views.” Prof. Soyinka reiterated that he does not participate in Facebook, Tweet, Blog, WhatsApp or other offerings of the social media. He stressed that any views that he wishes to express on national and other issues were routinely done through the print media.
