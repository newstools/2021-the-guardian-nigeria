• PDP alleges plot to fritter N1.7tr through NNPC deal
• Stakeholders hail decision as against refineries’ rehabilitation 
• Energy transition, oil demand drive fresh swap deals Except Dangote and other private refineries coming on board give preference to the Federal Government for patriotism sake, the NNPC may have to compete with other oil producers to supply crude to the entities in a move that will likely end crude swap deals with foreign firms. The Federal Government, through oil swap contracts, exchanges over 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day for fuel.
 
With energy transition ideals being reiterated globally, forcing oil majors to review their investment strategies, and slower oil demand in India, as well as United States’ preference for light sweet crude, Nigeria and other producers are exploring measures to find new buyers for their crude.
 
Already, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Monday, said there is no going back on acquisition of stakes in six private refineries, which are being developed in the country to ensure national energy security.  REACTING to the development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, alleged that there was a plot to divert some N1.7 trillion ($3.9 billion) to private pockets, under the guise of acquiring 20% shares in the $19. 5 billion refinery being built by Dangote Group. The party said it was worried by what it called “the opaque and nebulous deal being pushed by officials of the NNPC.”  HOWEVER, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the NNPC proposal is a move in the right direction, adding that the reality is that the Dangote refinery is a project of significant and strategic national importance, even though it is promoted by the private sector. 
 
“Taking a stake in the project also makes a great deal of economic and business sense, especially in the light of our heavy dependence on importation of petroleum products and the associated fiscal leakages. It would also impact on our macroeconomic conditions from the perspective of the preservation of our foreign reserves as we currently spend billions of dollars yearly on importation of petroleum products. 
 
“This is in addition to the several multiplier effects arising from related spin off industries like petrochemicals, fertilizers plants resonates well with our aspiration for self reliance and backward integration. The export prospects are also quite bright. The fact that the NNPC will be a minority shareholder offers a great deal of comfort. The undoing of our public enterprises has been the quality of management.  EARLIER, in a desperate effort to offload and sell stranded barges of oil last year, the Federal Government had offered oil traders huge discounts on crude oil grades below the $10 mark, as glut and energy imbalance triggered by coronavirus hit the oil industry.
 
Latest prices for most of government’s crude oil grades for sale in May, showed prices as low as $1.51 while two of Nigeria’s banner grades – Qua Iboe, and Bonny Light sold at discounts of $3.92 and $3.95 respectively the following month.
