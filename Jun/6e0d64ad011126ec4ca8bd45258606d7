“The man dies in him who keeps mute in the face of tyranny-“ Wole Soyinka. What are you supposed to do when conflict erupts, people get killed and human and property rights are being violated? I believe any person with a heart and moral compass would be compelled to condemn the aggressors. Not doing so is immoral, and raises the risk of violent escalation of the wrongdoing. Thus, to hide behind impartiality when we’re not judicial officers is cowardly. Since to sink in silence, when we should protest, makes cowards of men.  At the same time, this fifth amendment to the Constitution should abolish the House of Representatives effective from 2023. Thus making the National Assembly a unicameral chamber of senators with each region having 21 senators as the North West currently has; and one senator for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. And as part of the cost-cutting measures, every legislative house from the senate, the regional house of assembly, the state assembly, and the councillors of the Local Government Councils and Area councils will operate on a part-time basis.
   
Only the principal officers of the legislative house shall be on full pay. Constituency projects and allowances are to be abolished. Legislators shall factor their constituency projects into the federal, regional, state, and council budgets. Local Governments shall be in the purview and control of the regional government. Regional governors shall have the power to constitute local governments by appointment or cause councils to be elected by electoral commissions. There is nowhere in the world where local governments are independent. Independence of local governments is a ploy by immigrants to seize land from indigenous peoples.
