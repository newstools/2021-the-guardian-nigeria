Introducing the Biz Digitorial: The new product that converts your press releases into dynamic interactive formats.  Digitorials (digital advertorials) are short online editorial features that provide exciting new dimensions for your branded content, ideal for sharing via web or mobile.  A great animated format for new product launches, ad campaigns or market reports. All you need to do to see your content in these super-engaging, shareable formats is to submit the usual ±500-word article, engaging headline, subheadlines and pull quotes, and we’ll convert your press releases into a digitorial for you.  Digitorials can include video and advertising footage and are ideal for advertising agencies and companies that wish to package brand stories in one impressive page. Historic news, related articles or products can also be linked to provide a holistic picture of your company or organisation. How to supply content for Biz Digitorials: Materials required:   Visit the Biz Digitorial example, and enquire about one month’s exposure for your most current company or brand news within the heart of your business media space on Bizcommunity (http://BizCommunity.com).
