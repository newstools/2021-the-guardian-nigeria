Denrele Edun Speaks About His Experience After Dating A Man Nigerian media personality Denrele Edun has revealed the one time he dated a man and how it was the biggest mistake he had made in his life. He turned 40 and ahead of his birthday, he had a chat with Chude Jideonwo on his show ‘WithChude.’ Narrating his relationship experiences, he stated that the man in question was very toxic to him all through the period they saw each other. In his words: I have not been in too many relationships which is why I am always very skeptical about getting into them. So one day I said to myself, maybe the girls do not have anything to offer me and then I had quite a bit of male attention, so I said let me just give somebody a chance. That was the worse decision of my life. From then on, I have said I am my own sugar daddy. I have a strong masculine side designed to take care of my feminine side because the person I decided to experiment with was the most draining thing I had ever done in my life and I am never going to be caught in that sought of situation. I met the most disrespectful, most disregarding, the temper I had not seen. I tried to quell it. I said Okay so God, maybe you sent this man into my life because you wanted me to change this person, maybe you wanted me to fix it.
