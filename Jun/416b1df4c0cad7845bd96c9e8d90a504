He said: “Our country needs all the leaders, the best leaders, the most proactive leaders, leaders prepared to bring the country together. Lagos is a microcosm of Nigeria. Everybody is here. If things work out well here, things will be okay in the country.” Addressing the Oniru, Osinbajo noted: “I am sure your role here is that of someone who brings together communities not just the Yoruba, but everybody. And I can see that from your choice of chiefs, you have gone to other parts and I think this is the attitude of great leaders.” While praying for the Oba’s successful reign on the throne, the Vice President said the progress of his kingdom and the people would be determined by the quality of leadership he provides – a yardstick to measure the role of traditional rulers in the country. He continued: “You should know that you are always in my prayers because I believe that your role is crucial not just for the development of this state, but for the whole country. “Today, you cannot relegate traditional rulers because of the exposure and education of those who occupy that position.” On his part, the Oniru thanked the nation’s second citizen for his leadership and commitment to the progress of the nation.
