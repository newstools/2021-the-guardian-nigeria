There is controversy overpayment of ransom for the four abducted Chinese workers in Ogun State. The Chinese, who were among the expatriates handling the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project, were kidnapped last week at a village Oyo and Ogun states border. The incident occurred at Adeaga/Alaagba village in Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State. However, The Guardian gathered that they were freed by their abductors on Monday after payment of ransom. A source close to CCECC, the company handling the project, said some undisclosed amount of money was paid as a ransom to the kidnappers before the abducted workers were released on Monday. But the spokesperson for the Ogun State Police Command, Mr. Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the release, said the abducted Chinese workers were released by their captors after a manhunt was launched by the police. He, however, did not give details on how the four Chinese workers were released by the gunmen. Recall that a police officer who was guarding the construction workers was killed during the kidnap. It was gathered that some of the weapons and ammunition of the deceased police officer were allegedly taken away by the abductors.
