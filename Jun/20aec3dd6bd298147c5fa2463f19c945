I don’t want to stop now. I would like to experience those same emotions with the national team.” Jorginho, who has scored five goals in 29 appearances for Italy since 2016, also drew comparisons between Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella and Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante. “They are very similar in characteristics,” the 29-year-old said. “They have physical power, they run for all 90 minutes and cover the field. They give me a big hand in midfield recovering balls. “There are many great players here, with great personalities.” Four-time world champions Italy are looking for a second European Championship title after their sole triumph in 1968.
