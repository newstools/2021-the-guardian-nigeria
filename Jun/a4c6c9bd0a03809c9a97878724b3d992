It is a good time for Nigerian singer and songwriter, who simply goes by the name Maj as her newly released debut EP titled Sweet Rocket has been doing the numbers and giving her attention on the music scene. Maj  Maj, armed with her uber fine vocals, blended a simple sing-a-long with a hint of sensual lyrics narrating the everyday experiences of youths and their love lives in this new EP. Sweet Rocket was birthed with passion and assertiveness with the focus track Foreign Baby and standout tracks such as E No Mean Say and Hot Flame. The 5-track project is sure a classic piece. Speaking about her new project, the singer who is full of optimism for the EP said, “Sweet Rocket is inspired by love, money and everything in between. I’ve been working on it for quite some time. There are five songs on the EP, and four of them are new songs plus a bonus track. All the songs are my favorites, but if I had to pick one, it would be Hot Flame.” Produced by Emmeno and Ciq and released on the 21st of May, Maj is set to roll out more projects this year.
