Photo: GETTYIMAGES  Rising issuance of Commercial Papers (CPs) in Debt Capital Market (DCM) over regular equities financing has become a source of worry to capital market operators, as stakeholders fear that the trend could worsen the drought of new issues that have bedeviled the equities market since the 2007/2008 global financial crisis.  “Therefore, the economic situation determines which financial instrument will enjoy subscription from investors. Accordingly, Issuers are guided. There is competition between the Capital Market and Money Market in terms of attractiveness to the Issuer.” The NGX had introduced several initiatives to attract new listings to the nation’s bourse. For instance, the launch of the Premium Board in 2015 was meant to showcase deserving companies that have met the highest requirements on liquidity, corporate governance, and sustainability.
 
The premium board offers issuers the benefits of greater visibility and opportunities to attract liquidity from impact investors and Sovereign Wealth Funds.
 
The exchange also launched its Corporate Governance Index (CG Index) to provide investors with additional data points and strengthen listed companies, by tracking their corporate governance practices.
 
The exchange also developed a co-branded index series with MSCI, a globally recognised index service provider.  “Government should make policies to encourage more listing to deepen the market to play its role of driving the economic development by providing a platform for long-term borrowing. “Regulators should protect investors and collaborate with research companies to provide proper investment and financial education to attract more participants to the market,” Omordion said.
