To engage the army of restive youths in the country, the Federal Government has been tasked with increasing investments in information and technology.
  
These investments in IT are said to have the ability to ensure that the youths are constructively engaged.
 
This advice came from IT training company, NIIT Fortesoft Systems, when some youths recently graduated from its “Streets2click” programme sponsored by JMG Limited and Jamara Nigeria.
  
Some youths trained in graphics and hardware design graduated from the programme. 
  
The maiden edition of the training, which ran for six weeks, was aimed at empowering young, educationally disadvantaged Nigerian youths in order to put them in a better position for employment and self-empowerment purposes.
