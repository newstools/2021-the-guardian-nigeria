Sell-off in most blue-chip stocks, especially in that of Guaranty Trust Bank and Unilever, forced transactions on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) to reopen on a downward note yesterday, as the All-Share Index (ASI) depreciated by 0.10 per cent. Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the All-Share Index (ASI) dropped by 39.70 absolute points, representing a decline of 0.10 per cent to close at 38,686.40 points while market capitalisation declined by N21 billion to close at N20.164 trillion. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are Guaranty Trust Bank, Unilever Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) and FCMG Group. Reacting to market performance, analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: ”After the negative sentiment that dominated the Nigerian market today, we foresee a slight rebound as investors buy up some of the down beaten stocks in tomorrow’s session. Therefore, we anticipate a mixed session with a positive tilt.” Price losses outweighed gains as 13 stocks appreciated in price while 28 others constituted the losers’ chart.
