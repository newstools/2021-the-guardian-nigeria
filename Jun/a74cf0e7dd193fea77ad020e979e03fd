Gadot wrote: You give our girls the perfect example of how a man should behave and the love and patience you show them is endless. The unconditional support you give them and the knowing they will never walk alone ’cause you always got their back are such a strong base to who they will grow up to be. My love for you grows bigger every day, seeing you inspire them, teaching them, challenging them, loving them, I know they will become the amazing women we dream they will be. Thank you for being the dad that you are, more to come…   A post shared by Gal Gadot (@gal_gadot)  Gal Gadot, best-known to fans of DC cinematic universe as Wonder Woman, will soon be seen in Death On The Nile, an adaptation of Agatha Christie’s novel of the same name.
