We’re going to do it in a way that would make Chad proud.” “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler is also returning to direct from his screenplay. Back in May, Angela Bassett insisted that the film will be a fitting tribute to Boseman. Boseman died on August 28, 2020, as a result of complications related to colon cancer. ‘It’s going to be phenomenal and it’s going to pay tribute and it’s going to carry on that legacy,’ Bassett, 62, told USWeekly. Another star of the film Lupita N’yongo is also confident the sequel will satisfy fans. ‘It’s going to be different, of course, without our king, to go back into that world, but I know that all of us are dedicated to reimagining or carrying on his legacy in this new Black Panther,’ she said in an interview on Good Morning America in March. “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” is set to debut on July 8, 2022. Black Panther debuted in February 2018 and was an immediate box office smash hit. The superhero adventure opened with $202 million, going on to bank a massive $700 million domestic take and $1.347 billion worldwide. The film was the highest-grossing film at the domestic box office in 2018, and second worldwide, just behind Avengers: Infinity War ($2.048 billion).
