Ogallah said the country’s palm oil would be readily acceptable in the international market when its origin could be attributed to traceability and standardization regulations by authorities which determine how a product is presented in terms of quality and quantity. “When we are looking at traceability, it is a component; when discussing the issue of standardization, standards are set by authorities and when you get into the market, there is a particular standard that consumers want to see and that they will appreciate. The regulation of standards is by authorities who say that the quality, quantity and the nature or the presentation of a product must be in a particular way. “Nevertheless, traceability is linked to it because if you look at a product, you would want to know it’s origin, just like you would look at a product and ask what it is, you would also want to know where the product is from.

Is it possible to know the farm or in our own case here, the chain of farms and then the processor(s) that resulted in this particular oil palm product? “Internationally, we want to be able to prove ultimately that palm oil that comes from Akwa Ibom State from Nigeria are deforestation-free so that it will not be assumed that every palm oil on the shelf that is from Nigeria comes from farms that produce the oil palm from degrading forests.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
