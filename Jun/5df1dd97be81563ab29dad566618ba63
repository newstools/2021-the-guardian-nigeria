 Director-General, SMEDAN, Dr. Dikko Rada  Amid growing challenges of infrastructural decay and negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government will continue to support the growth of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria. This has become important especially, as MSMEs have successfully contributed to wealth creation and employment generation for Nigerian youths over the years. The Director-General of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Dikko Radda, disclosed this, yesterday, in a statement in preparation for the 2021 United Nations World MSMEs Celebration in Abuja. He said: ‘’It is, therefore, based on the relevance of MSMEs that United Nations set aside June 27, of every year, for the celebration of resilience and significance of the sector. It is important to note that Nigeria has celebrated the two previous World MSME Days with all stakeholders in the MSMEs ecosystem participating. “This year’s celebration is of special significance, as the Office of the of Vice President of Nigeria is taking the lead in putting together a series of activities marking the day.’’ The theme is: “MSMEs: Key to an inclusive and sustainable recovery.’’ He said MSMEs were drivers of a sustainable economic recovery across the globe. He said activities to mark the day included sensitisation and awareness campaigns, an exhibition where various MSMEs would showcase their products in a pavilion and a roadshow from the SMEDAN office to exhibition ground in a carnival-like manner among others.
