Joseph Hayab, in his opening speech at a peace and security summit in Kaduna, cited separatist agitations as part of the reactions. Hayab explained: “The security challenges in Nigeria, Kaduna State, in particular, is not a new thing to us; it is a monster that we have been struggling very hard, for decades, to deal with. Every government has had its fair share of this experience. “Accordingly, a keen look at our security challenges will reveal two basic facts; one is the proof that the challenge keeps changing with time while the second is that it is outrageous now.” He cited the Kaduna students’ riot in 1987, Zangon Kataf communal unrest in 1995, the Sharia crisis in 2000, the 2002 Miss World crisis, the 2011 post-election crisis and others as some of the reactions. “However, security challenges in Kaduna started taking a new form by the end of 2014 with banditry, cattle rustling, and guerilla attacks of towns and villages, especially in the southern part of the state which became worse by 2016,” he added.
