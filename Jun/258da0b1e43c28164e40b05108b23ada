 Terminal in TinCan Island port, Lagos.				         PHOTO: SUNDAY AKILOLU  The terminal operators said that operations inside the port terminals across the country are well organised and professionally coordinated by the concessionaires. Spokesman, STOAN, Dr. Bolaji Akinola, in a statement, disclosed that the major challenges facing port operations in the country are dilapidated port access roads, poor traffic management and manual examination of cargo by Customs. He said terminal operators, like other business entities in Apapa, are victims of the “dysfunctional state and chaos” on the port access roads. According to Akinola, “The port terminals are well organised and efficient. Concessionaires have done very well to ensure efficiency in their various terminals. The major problem is the road. Terminal operators do not have any role to play or responsibility to bear on the road. We don’t own the road; we don’t control the roads, and we don’t control happenings on the road. We cannot control the security agencies saddled with the responsibility of managing traffic on the road.” He said terminal operators, more than any other entity in the logistics chain, do bear the brunt of the Apapa traffic congestion because it hampers the evacuation of cargo from the port. “The business of terminal operators is to keep trade moving. We don’t make money from cargo sitting at the terminal. Our profitability is in the volume of cargo we handle. So it is in our best interest for cargo to leave the port as soon as possible. Unfortunately, those who profit from the chaos on the road make it difficult for trucks to move freely to evacuate cargo from the port,” he said. Akinola said the fact that the roads were cleared and rid of the notorious traffic anytime President Muhammadu Buhari visited Lagos “shows that security operatives know what to do to deliver us all from the pains we suffer daily from the gridlock.” He said: “In 2019, when the president visited Lagos, the otherwise intractable Apapa gridlock disappeared. The gridlock also disappeared on June 10, 2021 when the president visited Apapa to commission the rail line and the Deep Blue project. It was not terminal operators that cleared the road; it was the same security operatives that manned the road that cleared it. How did they make it happen? Can they continue to do so on a daily basis, what they did on those two occasions of Mr President’s visits? Meanwhile, Bello-Koko, during on-the-spot assessment visit to the TinCan Island Port highlighted some impediments to the smooth flow of traffic and effective security, within and around the port complex. While visiting the Sunrise Bus-Stop area of the Apapa – Mile 2 highway that had become a failed passage, he noted that the poor road situation within this corridor (the major artery in and out of the Tin Can Island Port) remains a huge concern to NPA. He observed that some of the internal roads within the Port Complex are in a state of disrepair, but assured that the Authority, in concert with other relevant agencies of Government and the National Assembly would mobilise resources as soon as possible to fix such roads. “It should be noted that the problem with the roads leading into and out of Apapa is caused by bad roads, numerous checkpoints mounted by security agencies and rickety trucks. If these three issues are addressed and adequate parking lots provided for trucks, the gridlock would become history. “The trucks that have direct business to do at the port are less than half the number of trucks you see on the road. The other half consists of petroleum tankers heading to petroleum jetties/tank farms and trucks owned by some Apapa-based manufacturing concerns such as Honeywell, Flour Mills and Dangote, among others. “A few days ago, the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko said NPA counted about 30 checkpoints mounted by security and traffic management officials on the roads in Apapa.
“The truth is that those who mount these illegal checkpoints are profiting from the chaos they deliberately create. It has nothing to do with terminal operators. We cannot control the activities of these government officials. Only government can call them to order,” he said. Akinola said private terminal operators at the seaports invested N538 billion in port development from 2006 when the ports were concessioned to December 2017. He said the ports have become much more efficient than they were before the 2006 port concession, “but those who thrive in chaos desperately want to cast aspersion on the concession exercise because orderliness does not benefit their pockets”.
