The video was directed by Kewa Oni and Seun Opabisi. Speaking on ‘FEELING‘ produced by Andre Vibez with a vocal assist from Buju, Ladipoe shares; ‘I wrote a poem called “How I’m Feeling Now”‘. This new song is a follow-up to Poe’s recent Rap offering – ‘Rap Messiah‘ and it said to be his first official single for this year 2021 after a successful 2020 with the hit song ‘Know You‘ which featured Simi. “Feeling” presents a sonic reprieve from our problems as Ladipoe raps about the need to find happiness even in the face of challenges. Life is short and the pursuit of happiness is what keeps us going. Here, Ladipoe and Buju say we should take a break, throw our hands in the air and let go. Watch the video below:
