Not easy to move out there,” tweeted British star Andy Murray. Williams, who also had strapping on her right thigh, hasn’t won a Slam since the 2017 Australian Open. William’s slip came at the same end of the court as that of Adrian Mannarino which brought a premature end to the Frenchman’s hard-fought match with Roger Federer. Mannarino slipped and fell late in the fourth set and pulled out at the beginning of the fifth set. Federer remarked he felt that the surface was more slippery when the roof is in use which it had been due to rain earlier on Tuesday.
