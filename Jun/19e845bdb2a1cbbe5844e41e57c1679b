Fuwape President of Organisation for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), Professor Ibiyinka Fuwape, has told African women scientists that the world awaits Africa-developed vaccine. She consequently challenged women scientists to acquire new skills that would assist them to leverage technology, so that they could survive in their various fields and disciplines. The OWSD president threw the challenge yesterday while virtually addressing the opening session of the OWSD three-day conference themed ‘Making Research Count in National Development: The Role of Women Scientists’ being hosted by the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Abia State. She stated that the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) opened new research questions, which women scientists, especially Africans, could take advantage of, to showcase their talents. “The whole world is desperately waiting for a vaccine developed in Africa,” he said, adding that while a lot is yet to be understood about COVID-19, some countries were going through the third phase. Noting under-representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) as well as Innovation, Fuwape further said: “As women in science, we need to work to bridge this gap and come up with recommendations from this conference that will translate into policy to support the recruitment and retention of women and girls in science.” Declaring the conference open, Abia State governor’s wife, Dr. Nkechi Ikpeazu, stated that over time, there had been a globally orchestrated effort at getting more women involved in science and technology.
