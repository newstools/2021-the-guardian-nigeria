I want to urge the geo-political zone to contest for the highest office in the land come 2023. We must be ready to present a candidate. I may be one of those that will seek the position. “If my party, the PDP, finally decides to throw the ticket open, I will declare my intention. I will not re-contest for Senate in 2023, but I might be seeking the highest office. We (South-South) have been cheated enough in the past.” He continued: “You could remember when Goodluck Jonathan was to return to office in 2015, the North opposed. There was a serious gang up against the South-South. This time, things will be different. We must present a candidate, but that will depend on whether the party will zone the ticket or leave it open.” He decried the imposition of successors on the people by outgoing governors in the states, urging that the trend should be halted before the 2023 polls. “This is democracy and the citizens must be allowed to choose their leaders by themselves. I want this incumbent governor to correct the mistakes of the past by not imposing their successors on the people,” Ekpenyong cautioned.
