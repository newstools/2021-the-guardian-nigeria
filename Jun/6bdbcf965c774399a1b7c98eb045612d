Four Chinese working at the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project were yesterday, abducted in Ogun State by gunmen while a policeman was killed during the operation. The policeman was one of the security men escorting the Chinese expatriates who were abducted. It was gathered that the gunmen, numbering about eight, laid ambush for the victims at Adeaga/Alaagba village in Odeda Local Government Area of the state on Wednesday. It was further gathered that the fierce-looking gunmen suspected to be herdsmen were dressed in a black caftan and abducted the expatriates in the village located between Oyo and Ogun States. The police spokesman in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. He disclosed that the command had deployed tactical teams and was on the trail of the kidnappers. Oyeyemi, however, said the police could not ascertain whether the gunmen were Fulani herdsmen or not. “It is true the incident happened yesterday (Wednesday). The victims are Chinese expatriates working at the construction site at the terminus of the railway around Alaagba area, not far from Kila. “The gunmen laid ambush for the victims on their way and they were attacked. A police officer escorting them was killed. “We have started the investigation. We are on the trail of those people and hopefully, we are going to get them. “All our tactical teams have been deployed to that direction and we are trying to locate them and we believe that by the grace of God, we are going to get them. “We cannot say for now if the abductors are Fulani herdsmen until when we are able to get them,” the PPRO said.
