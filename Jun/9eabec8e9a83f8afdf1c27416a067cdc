With increasing inflation and dwindling economy, there is need for businesses to be creative and innovative to ensure brand  sustainability, a business expert, Adewale Shote, has said. Shote said  it is about time Nigeria started creating businesses and companies that would not only stand the test of time but would also grow globally. He spoke at the ‘Get Artee’ competition organised by Tastee Fried Chicken in Lagos. Shote, who doubles as the Business Transformation Director, said the competition was aimed at enhancing the creativity of the younger generation while positioning them to emerge as economic solution innovators. He said the firm is going through a transformation process and understands the essential role youths can play in the development and sustainability of the organisation. He said Nigeria is buoyant with talented and creative youths that should be harnessed for economic diversification, development and sustainability. Speaking on the sustainability of the brand for over two decades, Shote said: “We are trying to make sure the company stays for a couple of generations, which is very rare in the country today. “In terms of transformation, we are looking at a number of things. We are looking at new products, coming up with creativity and innovation. We are coming up with things that have not been seen in the industry before. A lot of concepts are being developed at the moment and we will start to roll out in the near future. Tastee is a family-oriented business. What we are trying to do is to transform the business in a way that is very evolving and accommodating.” He said the company is positioned to serve customers right, saying, “The food industry is changing and if you look at the pattern within which food is being consumed now, it is totally different. A lot of people are on the move; a lot of online activities going on and what that means is that it affects how we move. It is affecting how we live; we need to be able to transform to meet the demands of people.” Announcing the winners of the drawing competition, Shote said the organisation is really excited to have children embrace the journey towards transformation. “It is exciting because we are building the next generation of youths who would emerge as leaders and innovators of economic solutions in our society. “It is good to start with them at their early stages of life in order to ensure they experience how businesses are being operated as they support us to innovate ideas, decision making, concepts, and contents amongst other things we are trying to achieve.” Shote added: “Those that emerged as the first, second and third place contestants alongside their prizes, would contribute towards the rebranding of the organisation, as they would be tasked to generate creative concepts for the firm.” The winners, drawn from the top ten finalists were given 40 minutes to draw the Tastee Fried Chicken Mascot. However, Dorcas Oyetunji from Princeton College, Surulere emerged first, winning a PlayStation 4; Teniola Anthony of Child of Promise School, Ajah, emerged the second position with an HP Laptop, while Israel Isaac from Nathan Nursery and Primary School, Yaba emerged third place, won a bicycle.
