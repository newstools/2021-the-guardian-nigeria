Professor Omotsola Daniel of the University of Abuja chairs the five-member jury. The jury will adjudicate on all entries in the competitive category of the film festival, which is themed Show The Money, chosen to further the conversation on investment opportunities available in digital content creation and exhibition. NFC, in a statement issued in Jos, Plateau State and signed by Brian Etuk, Head of Public Affairs, listed other members of the Jury to include Professor Alex Chinwuba Asigbo of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka; Dr. Oluwatosin Kooshima Tume, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; Nasiru Bappah Muhammed of Moving Image Film Production Company, Kano and Yinka Oduniyi, President of Independent Television Producers of Nigeria (ITPAN), Lagos. The statement quotes Dr. Chidia Maduekwe NFC’s Managing Director/Chief Executive as saying that ZUFF 2021 will provide participants with knowledge-based information and networking opportunities that are available within online digital platforms for the development, marketing and distribution of content, at minimal cost, but with huge return on investment. Maduekwe reiterated the role of the jury in ensuring a successful film festival. He said, “the jury is most critical to the selection of winning entries of ZUFF which has obviously set the pace in film festival organisation and management since it was rebranded in 2017 to become a yearly event in December every year.” Maduekwe assured that NFC would deploy its capacity enablement for a successful film festival, which he said, was open for domestic and foreign collaboration and partnership. Speaking on membership of the jury, the NFC boss expressed his strong belief that members of the jury, who have contributed immensely to the growth of film production in Nigeria, would bring their experience to bear as the NFC forges ahead to institute a world class film festival for the country. Omatsola, a Professor of Media Arts Criticism, who chairs the jury, has served and participated in various film festivals, film production development programmes and projects, as well as cultural activities.
