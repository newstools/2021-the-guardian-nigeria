International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC), Nigeria chapter, has hinted at slight market recovery going by the rig counts, stressing the need for prioritisation of training and retraining of members to meet industry’s standards.
 
It, however, noted that a revival of the Iranian nuclear deal will lead to an increase in global supply, while the oil market is anticipating that Iran’s supply will pick up again by late summer.
   
“This notwithstanding, it is expected that the demand recovery will be strong enough to absorb it,” Chairman of IADC, Nigeria chapter, Chuks Enwereji, of Shelf Drilling Offshore Services, said at the 2021 HSE Awards & Technical Session Webinar of the Nigeria, chapter of IADC.  While presenting plaques to members who participated in the 2020 Incident Statistics Program (ISP), and the winner of the best performance in 2020, IADC Nigeria Chapter Vice Chairman, Valentine Iheasirim stated that the essence of sharing knowledge through the webinar was to “Sustain and build culture of safety, given that drilling operations cut across land, swamp, shallow and deep waters.
  
Following the award criteria and the independent committee’s report, Shelf Drilling Nigeria Limited posted the best safety performance and emerged as the winner in the 2020 Incident Statistics Program (ISP).  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
