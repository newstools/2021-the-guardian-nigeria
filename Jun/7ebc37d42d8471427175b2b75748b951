According to a statement by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, yesterday, the governor noted that the late Madam Adesegun lived a fulfilled life, saying: “No matter the age, the loss of one’s mother is bound to be painful and emotionally distressing.” Abiodun described Mama Adesegun as “a quintessential woman of virtue who was privileged to have great children,” such as Segun Adesegun, among other successful siblings. This ordinarily gives a sense of fulfilment”. “Accept my sincere condolences, that of members of my immediate family and the good people of Ogun State in general, on the demise of the nonagenarian,” Abiodun submitted.
