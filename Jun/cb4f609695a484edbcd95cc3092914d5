 The women during a rally in Abuja…yesterday  Hundreds of women under the aegis of Amalgamation of Northern Women of Nigeria have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to organise a referendum on clamour for actualisation of Biafran Republic.

Let Igbo have their independent nation…” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
