The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has directed those candidates, who were to take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) in delisted centres to print new notification slips. In a statement by its spokesman, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, JAMB asked the affected applicants to start the printing from Sunday.
THIS came as the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) charged the examinations body on regularisation of university admissions from 2017 to 2019. In a statement by its Public Relations Officer, Victor Ezenagu, the body claimed: “Our attention has been drawn to a draconian decision of JAMB not to regularise admissions done in 2017, 2018 and 2019 for unclear reasons. It is highly regrettable that at a time when the nation is making frantic efforts to ensure that youths are given opportunity to acquire education, JAMB is desperately trying to frustrate the efforts.” It argued that by suspending regularisation of admissions through the Central Administration Processing System (CAPS) for students who got admitted during the period under review after reportedly paying between N5000 and N8,500, the affected persons may not be able to participate in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, as their admissions would be termed illegal.
