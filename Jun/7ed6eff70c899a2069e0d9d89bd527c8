Police Line PHOTO: Shutterstock Two protesters were shot dead and four were wounded in clashes with security forces in Ghana’s southern Ashanti region, police and a health official said Wednesday. The protesters were demonstrating against the death of a popular youth activist, Ibrahim “Kaaka” Mohammed, when they were confronted by police and soldiers on Tuesday in the town of Ejura. “Two people died during the clashes,” said police spokesman Godwin Ahianyo. Police were investigating the incident and calm had been restored to the area, he said. A health official confirmed that two people died and four others were injured. “One died before arrival. We tried to resuscitate the other but he died later,” said Manyee Mensah, medical superintendent at the Ejura Government Hospital. “Currently, we have four injured persons… One is in a critical condition but the other three are stable,” Mensah told AFP by phone. Mohammed was killed by unknown gunmen near his house in a suburb of Ejura on Sunday. He was an outspoken critic of the government on social media. Police said they had arrested two suspects in connection with his death. “We’re on top of issues and I want to assure the public everything is under control,” Ahianyo said. The violence coincides with a simmering political and social protest movement called #FixTheCountry. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
