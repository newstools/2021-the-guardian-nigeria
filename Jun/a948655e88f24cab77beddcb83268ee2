With increasing growth of regional hubs across West Africa, the need for agencies in the media and marketing space to reinvent and reposition themselves as solution providers to attract competitiveness has been emphasised.
 
Experts, who noted that Nigeria was already a hub for services in the digital space, said more efforts were required to position services for critical hubs to gain global competitiveness in West Africa. 
 
Group Managing Director, Mediafuse Dentsu International and guest speaker at the yearly general meeting of Media Independent Practitioners Association of Nigeria (MIPAN), Emeka Okeke, said it was important agencies came together for knowledge sharing to position the industry for changes happening within the market.  He said businesses must be done in the right way and ethical standards.
 
While assuring the Council’s support for MIPAN, he disclosed that APCON has approved MIPAN academy, known as Alphabet Media Academy, which qualifies one to become an associate of APCON after taking appropriate exams.
 
Earlier, President, MIPAN, Femi Adelusi, said the theme was apt, especially, at this time, to allow members and agencies to learn and restructure their businesses as well as teams on how to approach the market for the long term survival. 
 
Adelusi, who mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic led to the shutdown of many agencies in the sector, said the best survival lesson from those who survived was to collaborate and learn from each other.
 
The MIPAN boss called for a change of mind and approach by members to work together as an industry.
 
On tackling quacks in the industry, Adelusi said a committee on ethics and operational standards had been set up to put an end to it and also sanitise the industry.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
