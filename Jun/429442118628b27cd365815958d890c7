 Bala Mohammed. Photo/FACEBOOK/BauchiStateNigeria  Mohammed made this known yesterday when a political pressure group, the Northern Youth Leaders Forum (NYLF), visited him and asked him to throw his hat in the ring. He promised to make consultations across all political divides in the country after which he would come out with his position on the race. National Chairman of NYLF, Elliot Afiyo, was optimistic that the governor would not turn down their demand. He noted: “During our last meeting in Gombe, we scrutinised 47 people across the country and Mohammed was one of the leading names that came up. We subjected the leading names into votes and he emerged the winner and it was unanimously endorsed.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
