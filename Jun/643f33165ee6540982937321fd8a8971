A helpless old woman was burnt to death and over 50 houses razed in Shongom Local Government Area of Gombe State.
 
The carnage was perpetrated by some youths over a land dispute.
 
The state government confirmed this yesterday while briefing the press after an emergency security meeting.
 
It was learnt that the land dispute was between Shongom and Pero communities in Shongom Local Government.
 
According to the Commissioner for Internal Security and Ethical Orientation, Adamu Kulpto Dishi, said though no arrest had been made, “we shall start to arrest after investigation by the security agencies.”
  
According to him, the state government has directed security agencies to commence investigation into the crisis, “because crises can’t just descend from the sky; we want the Department of State Security (DSS) and the police to investigate and we as the state shall deal ruthlessly with the perpetrators or anyone found wanting in the heinous crime,” he said.
 
Meanwhile, the security council has directed stakeholders to caution the youth not to stretch the fragile peace in the area.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
