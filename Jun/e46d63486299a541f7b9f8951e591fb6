 Video-sharing platform, YouTube, has unveiled two new initiatives.<br />Photo: PIXABAY  This was the introduction to a daily newsletter I get in my inbox. Being left-handed, one of the members of the 10 per cent minority in a world of right-handers, I was fascinated by this information, also a bit annoyed with myself that I hadn’t heard of it before. Imagine, if as a leftie, I didn’t know this, how would a right-handed person understand the challenges for a leftie in a world designed for the right-handed majority. A few examples that come to mind: scissors, spiral notebooks, right-handed desks, can openers to name a few… The newsletter went on to introduce an article on the history of photography that favoured lighter skin tones over darker ones following the recent news that Google and Snapchat both recently announced that they are redesigning their cameras to be more inclusive to individuals who have darker skin.
 
In a nutshell, the first model to pose for camera calibration in photo labs was a woman named Shirley Page, which meant, all colour calibration after that, done with cards nicknames “Shirley cards”, were set to calibrate lighter skin, labelled as ‘normal.’ It wasn’t until the 1970s that Kodak started testing cards with black women.
