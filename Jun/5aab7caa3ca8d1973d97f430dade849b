 PDP National Chairman Secondus. Photo: TWITTER/MRUDOMEMMANUEL  Orbih, who described it as wicked, said it is uncharitable and unacceptable for anyone from the Niger Delta to leave PDP for APC. The South-south Zonal Vice Chairman said this while speaking at the stakeholders meeting held in Calabar, stating that “APC had brought untold hardship on the people of this nation and God will not forgive them. “Let me share my observation with you. We drove from Port Harcourt to Calabar this afternoon, going through the roads; you will agree with me that it is wicked, uncharitable and unacceptable for anybody from the Niger Delta to move from PDP to APC. “There is nothing APC will bring on the table in the South-South, is it the insecurity, is it kidnapping, is it the bad economy. Today, the naira is on the free fall. Just look at the exchange rate and you will weep for our dear country. There is also no basis for any person to leave the PDP for the APC.” Satisfied with the calibers of party faithful at the meeting, the Zonal Chairman said: “From my observation at this meeting, it is very clear that the South-South is PDP. It is very clear that the state is a PDP state with or without Governor Ben Ayade.” Also commenting, the state party leader, former Governor, Senator Liyel Imoke and senator representing Cross River Central district, Senator Sandy Onoh said the party has only lost a governor, but not the entire state. They said: “Let Ayade take over the secretariat, but we are surely going to take over the government house in 2023.” In his remark, former Deputy Governor, now PDP Caretaker Committee Chairman, Efiok Cobham, urged party members to prepare to work hard and redeemed the party from stomach infrastructure leader.
