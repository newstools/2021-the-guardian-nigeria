The Senate has confirmed the appointment of Major-General Farouk Yahaya as substantive Chief of Army Staff. The confirmation came after the consideration of the report of the Joint Committee on Defence and Army which was laid by the joint chairman, Senator Aliyu Wamakko (Sokoto North) during plenary. Wamakko had indicated that the joint committees found Yahaya worthy of the appointment, considering his pedigree in the Nigerian Army and experience in tackling insurgency in the country. The chairman, Committee on Army, Ali Ndume (Borno North), also said during the screening exercise, almost all members of the committee were present though the exercise was done behind close doors due the sensitivity of the screening. Senator Gabriel Suswam (Benue West) said Yahaya’s appointment is justified because he knows a lot about how to handle terrorism and insurgency. “I believed that once he is confirmed ,he would be able to tackle the problems of terrorism and insurgency,” said Suswam. President Muhammadu Buhari had on June 3 forwarded to the Senate, a request for the confirmation of  Yahaya as Chief of Army Staff. Buhari in the letter said Yahaya’s appointment was in compliance with the provisions of Section 18 subsection 1 of the Armed Forces Act 2004. Yahaya took over from former Chief of Army Staff, Major General Attahiru Ibrahim, who died in a plane crash near the Kaduna International Airport about two weeks ago.
