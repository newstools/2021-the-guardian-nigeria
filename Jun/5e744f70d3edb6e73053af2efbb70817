Narrating her ordeal, Anunobi said she is “still in awe of God”. “He changes destinies in a twinkling of an eye. He is the rule breaker. He doesn’t need any one’s permission to bless someone. Just look at the girl, whose rich father refused to train after high school, that he had no need for a girl child,” Anunobi wrote. According to Anunobi, her father said that the female gender was “useless to him and can’t carry his name any where”.

She said she struggled all by herself. “And now that girl child is a PH.D holder in Christian Education And Ministerial Arts. And she has engraved her father’s name on the map of the world and still carving it and will keep carving it until the return of Jesus Christ. I am that girl child and my name is apostle Dr Eucharia Akuwa Anunobi.” Anunobi came into limelight for her role in the film series Glamour Girls in 1994 and has gone on to star in over 90 film including Abuja Connection and Letters to a Stranger.
