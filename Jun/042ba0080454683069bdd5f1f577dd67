At 30-15, a Kenin serve nipped the line but Pegula thought it was out. The Umpire affirmed the call despite Pegula’s prolonged protest as the crowd booed. Kenin delivered a winning serve to clinch the set. Apparently still miffed by the call, Pegula lost her serve in the opening game of the third set but Kenin returned the favour. A second service break and a hold gave Kenin a 3-1 lead. Pegula recovered from an opening double fault to reduce the tally while Kenin struggled to deuce to take the sixth game. Serving at 2-5, Pegula dropped the first point and then battled to 40-30 before taking the game on the first advantage point. Serving for the match, Kenin reached 40-0 but double-faulted to 40-15, lost the second match point before delivering a service winner to clinch the game 6/4 for the victory. The top-seeded, Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round by defeating Lithuania’s Ricardas Berankis 6/1; 6/4; 6/2 while Spain’s Rafael Nadal, the second seed, prevailed over Britain’s Cameron Norrie, 6/3; 6/3; in a battle of southpaws.
