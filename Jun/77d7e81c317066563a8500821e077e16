 Stock Exchange  Yesterday, the ASI dropped by 73.01 absolute point, representing a decline of 0.19 per cent to close at 37,585.25 points while the overall market capitalisation value lost N34 billion to close at N19.593 trillion. The downturn was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, among which are: Presco, BOC Gases, Conoil, Africa Prudential and Zenith Bank Plc. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage firm said: “As expected, the market began on a mixed note, between buying and sell offs and we expect this to remain in tomorrow’ session, albeit with a slightly negative tilt.
