The test, aimed at preparing candidates for the UTME proper scheduled for between June 19 and July 3, 2021, was administered by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) in all computer-based test centres (CBTs) nationwide. JAMB Head of Media and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, told journalists in Abuja that the essence of the mock exam was to test the capacity and suitability of the centres. Fabian added that the exercise conducted nationwide was hitch-free, except in Dominion International School, Jabi, Abuja where fire gutted the centre and candidates were redirected to other centres. “Over 160,617 candidates sat for the mock examinations in all our CBT centres. We received report of complaint of capacity and stability in one or two centres,” he said. He assured that JAMB was prepared for the UTME between June 19 and July 3, 2021 due to the success of the mock examination.
