The training was held in collaboration with another Foundation, the Bashir Illo Foundation. In his remarks, Illo noted that 60 per cent of the three million inhabitants of Argungu are the youth, hence the decision to lift some of them out of poverty by equipping them with different skills. Coordinator of the programme, Alhaji Aminu Sakaba, thanked Malami for his support; the Emir of Argungu, Alhaji Samaila Mera; the Argungu Area Council and Government Technical College, Argungu, for making facilities available.
