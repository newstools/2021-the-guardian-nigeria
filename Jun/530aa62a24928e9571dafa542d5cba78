 Pastor W. F. Kumuyi  The General Superintendent of Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi has urged Christians to seek God’s intervention over security challenges in the country. Kumuyi made the call, yesterday, in the message entitled, ‘Super Living Through Divine Connection’ in Abuja, via zoom and other social media platforms to reach millions of participants across the 36 states and the rest of the world. The clergyman, who has been concerned with the spiritual, physical, health, emotional and economic challenges of Nigerians amid the pandemic, declared that working without progress would be taken away from the lives of citizens if they Christians could connect to God. He said: “Suffering came as a result of sin. Today, the Lord wants to repair and restore all that is broken down, only if people will come back and reconnect to Him.” Similarly, the immediate past President of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Pastor Abraham O. Akinosun, has appealed to Nigerians to fear God and respect humanity.
 
The cleric, while addressing the media yesterday, during a send-off service organised for him at All Saint’s Chapel in Ibadan, said lack or diminishing consciousness of Godliness and fear of God were affecting the world negatively.
 
Akinosun blamed insecurity on lack of fear of God in people’s hearts. He said: “Whosoever fears God will not take any action that would jeopardise the wellbeing of fellow humans and his country.”
 
He also admonished Nigerian leaders, including religious and traditional rulers to be conscious of Heaven.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
