Lupin | Netflix To execute and get away with the many crimes he commits, the main character of Netflix’s Lupin, Assane Diop (Omar Sy), has to engage in a little bit of trickery. Specifically, the art of disguise. Throughout the show, we see Assane don a wide variety of disguises to fool the police and to bring down Hubert Pellegrini, the man who framed Assane’s father for the theft of a diamond necklace 25 years prior to the start of the show. In the style of his idol, the fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise, Arsen Lupin, Assane goes through these disguises effortlessly, sometimes even switching identities mid-heist. Below are some of his looks: Luis Perenna

This is the first disguise we see Assane in. In the show’s first episode, he pretends to be a man named Luis Perenna and applies for a job as a janitor at the Louvre, the world’s largest art museum. We find out later in the episode that he does this so he can steal The Queen’s Necklace, the same necklace his father was framed for stealing. Paul Sernine
