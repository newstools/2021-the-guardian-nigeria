Osifeso, however, did not confirm the number of casualties nor the burning of any property. He said investigation was ongoing and that an update on the incident would be made available later. According to him, on Saturday at about 2310 hour, a yet to be ascertained number of unknown assailants invaded Igangan Town with dangerous weapons in a bid to create unrest in the town. “The unscrupulous elements were, however, repelled by a combination of operational and tactical assets deployed to the scene to restore normalcy. “The situation is being closely monitored and investigations are ongoing to apprehend the perpetrators,” Osifeso said.
