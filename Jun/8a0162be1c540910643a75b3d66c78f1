• We’ll support Uzodimma with ideas, group pledges
• Stop corrupting Imo workers, PDP tells gov Imo State Deputy Governor, Placid Njoku, has dismissed reports that he has resigned as the number two citizen of the Eastern Heartland, urging Imolites and the general public to regard it as fake news. His Chief Press Secretary, Ozioma Ukwuoma, stated yesterday: “My attention has been drawn to the fake news circulating in the social media purporting that the deputy governor of Imo, Professor Placid Njoku, has resigned. “While it remains our practice to ignore such baseless stories, the need to put the truth out to concerned Imo citizens has necessitated this rebuttal.” According to Njoku, there is no iota of truth in the story, but “a mere figment of the imagination of those working against the   government and people of Imo” HOPE Rising for Imolites has pledged to support Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State with ideas that would tackle security challenges, boost the state’s economy and create jobs. The group led by Success Akagburuonye, during a solidarity visit to the governor in Owerri, yesterday, identified unemployment as a major cause of insecurity and other social vices in the state. Prominent politicians, technocrats among others people the group. Akagburuonye and former Imo House of Assembly member, Gabriel Amadi, who spoke on behalf of the group, applauded Governor Uzodimma for his achievements, especially in the areas of infrastructure and human capacity. An address presented by former National Organising Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Gozie Nwachukwu, at the visit, the group said: “Your Excellency, we are aware of the much you have achieved within this short period and we seek ways of partnering with you in surmounting your administrative challenges. The challenges of party cohesion, insecurity, increase in revenue generation and infrastructural development.” MEANWHILE, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo has urged the governor to stop corrupting the organised labour in the state, by compelling them to join to fight opposition. In a statement yesterday, Imo PDP Publicity Secretary, Ogubundu Nwadike, however, described the leading opposition party in the state as a friend of the organised labour everywhere. “We feel that struggling to conscript the leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) into the army of enemies of Imo State, which the current regime has steadily proved itself to be, would never be to the advantage of the regime. The relationship between organised opposition and organised labour in Imo will continue to remain cordial, as Imo PDP is very cognisant of its roles in the state.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
