 Ahmad Lawan: Photo Twitter  He stated this in his remarks on a Point of Order raised by Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Jibrin Barau during plenary yesterday. Barau had raised Point of Order 43 of Senate Standing Rules seeking more time to submit the report on ‘A Supplementary Bill for an Act to authorise the issue from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation the total sum of N895, 842, 465, 917.’ He said that having started work on the bill, the committee discovered it needed more time to meet the minimum standard set out by the rules of the Senate in processing the bill. “The expected time we feel we will be able to do this is this week and then get our report submitted on Tuesday next week. I appeal that this distinguished Senate permits us to submit our report on Tuesday next week,” he said. Lawan however turned down the request, saying he could not have more than 24 hours. “It is not a complicated thing. You don’t need up to Tuesday next week. So, you submit tomorrow (today),” he said.
