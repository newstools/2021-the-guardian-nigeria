However, after that development, the interest rate started to rise in primary market for debt, which mopped financial assets away from equities. “There was also no extraordinary price sensitive information to drive equities in May which the market had not already reacted to in April. The heightened state of insecurity in May also adversely affected investors’ confidence. “ He said June is not expected to be different from May because the second-quarter results will come in July, unless propelled by yet unknown price-sensitive developments. “However, from the perspective of the economy, further growth of GDP and decline in Inflation can enhance investors confidence, enabling them to take on more risk.
