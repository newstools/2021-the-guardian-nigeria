Since his arrival as Ambassador to Japan in 2018, Ambassador Ngoma had contributed greatly to the development of bilateral relations between Japan and the Republic of Congo. Your Excellency attended the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD 7) held in August 2019 and contributed to the success of the conference, during which the Foreign Ministers of our both countries agreed to strengthen our bilateral relations. I believe that this was also thanks to the dedicated efforts of Ambassador Ngoma.  Paying tribute to Ambassador Ngoma in memory of his achievements during his lifetime, I pray for the repose of his soul. Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan
