The figure however was as high as 72 percent in the United States but went down to 57 percent in South Africa, where a more transmissible variant is dominant.

At least 225 million jabs are urgently required if the majority of the countries are to meet the deadline, she said. Africans have received less than one percent of the over 2.1 billion doses administered globally, according to the WHO. Just one in 50 of the continent’s nearly 1.3 billion people have received one jab, it said. Africa has been hit by a near standstill in vaccine deliveries, partly caused by lack of supplies from India, which is battling its own flareup of Covid-19. The WHO urged wealthier countries to share vaccines — a need that Moeti described as “do or die.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
