The House of Representatives has threatened to sanction the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Inspector General of Police (IGP), Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and others for failing to honour its invitation within 72 hours. This followed a motion adopted by the House Ad-hoc Committee investigating the assessment and status of recovered loots, movable and immovable assets from 2002 to 2020 during resumed hearing. Chairman of the Committee, Adejoro Adeogun, lamented the non-appearance of heads of various agencies of government invited to appear before its members.
 He accused the representatives of the agencies of impersonation, having failed to submit a formal letter of introduction from their principals in which they were assigned to represent them. Adeogun insisted that by undermining the committeeâ€™s invitation, the agencies had indirectly undermined the National Assembly, stressing that the committee gave them till Thursday, June 10, 2021 to appear or risk being sanctioned in line with sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 Constitution.
