Photo: nairametrics Price gains by most blue-chip stocks, especially MRS and Vitafoam, aided a rebound on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) as market reopened in an upbeat yesterday, causing market capitalisation to rise by N94 billion. At the close of trading yesterday, market capitalisation increased by N94 billion from N19.940 trillion recorded last week Friday to N20.034 trillion. Also, the All-Share Index (ASI) appreciated by 180.93 points or 0.4 per cent from 38,256.95 to 38,437.88. Analysts at Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Despite the positive market close, sentiment in the market noticeably tilted to the bearish side as the ASI closed with more losers than gainers. “Therefore, we anticipate a mixed session tomorrow, with a negative tilt amid weak activity levels and no discernible catalyst to drive market activity.” United Capital Plc said: “We expect a short term rebound in the equities market as sell pressures dissipate, giving room for the bulls to regain temporary control of the market in a tight trading week. “In addition, the ASI is technically oversold and is due for a temporary rebound. We also expect investor sell-offs and profit-taking in insurance stocks which rallied in the previous week.” The upturn was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; BUA Cement, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), MRS Oil Nigeria, Vitafoam Nigeria and Julius Berger Nigeria.
