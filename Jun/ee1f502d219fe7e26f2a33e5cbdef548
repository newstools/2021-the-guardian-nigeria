The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said yesterday that it may ask the court to interpret the legality or otherwise of the defection of Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State to the All Progressives Congress (APC). It categorically cautioned Matawalle to know that his defection amounted to a decision to vacate office, as no law allowed him to cross over to any other party with the governorship mandate statutorily given to the PDP through the ballot box. Briefing journalists in Abuja, the National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the matter had been established by the 1999 Constitution and a judgment of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the dissolution of the state executive body of the party.
