On two occasions in Lagos, the Nigerian male relay teams fumbled, while their female counterparts were celebrated. The quartet of Blessing Okagbare, Grace Nwokocha, Favour Ofili and Rosemary Chukwuma picked the 4x100m ticket during the AFN/Olympics Trials at YABA TECH last Sunday, while the quartet of Patience Okon-George, Nse Imaobong, Favour Ofili and Knowledge Omovoh joined the Tokyo Olympics train on Thursday at the Teslim Balogun Stadium after they stormed to a Season’s Best of 3:26.83s at the Lagos Open Athletics Championship. With three days to go before the qualifying window for the Olympics closes on June 29, Nigerian male relay teams, as well as 4×400 Mixed Relay have another golden chance tomorrow at the Making of Champions (MoC) Invitational holding at YABA TECH. According the Chief Executive Officer of MoC, Bombo Akani, tomorrow’s event sponsored by Paga is aimed at providing last chance for Nigerian and African athletes seeking Olympic qualification in both their Individual Events and the Relays to do so. About five African countries have arrived in Lagos for the event. The Paga/MoC Relays will feature 24 athletics events, including 18 individual (10 Track and eight Field) events and six Relays. Nigerian men’s 4x100m team was rooted in same 18th position on the list of countries battling for the Olympics ticket on Thursday as the quartet of Enoch Adegoke, Usheoritse Itsekiri, Jerry Jakpa and Godson Brume could not live up to expectation. Meanwhile, President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Tonobok Okowa told The Guardian yesterday that he is still hopeful of the men picking their relay tickets. “Anything can still happen. We will continue to push until it is over.” He urged the male athletes to do everything possible to grab the last opportunity provided by the MoC Invitational Relays.
