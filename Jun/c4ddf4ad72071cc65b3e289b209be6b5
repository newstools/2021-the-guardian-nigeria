The complaint, addressed to chairperson of the commission, Solomon Ayele Dersso and Commissioner/Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Jamesina Essie L. King, was brought pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission. The query, signed by SERAP’s deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, followed the move to “push through two repressive bills to amend the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Press Council Act. The bills are reportedly sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, Segun Odebunmi (PDP, Oyo State).”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
