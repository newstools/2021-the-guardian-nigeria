Three persons, including a pregnant woman, were reportedly killed yesterday in an accident that occurred around 5:00 a.m. on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The accident happened at Danco axis of the highway, inbound Lagos, barely two days after a tanker explosion killed two persons on the Ogere stretch of the road. It was gathered that the pregnant woman was in a bus conveying tomatoes, and the crash involved a DAF truck (flat body) with registration number XY 895 GGE and a granite-laden Iveco truck marked JBD 16 XY were involved in the accident. The accident also involved a Mazda bus (LND 676 XX) loaded with tomatoes and another Mazda bus (BDG 755 YA) loaded with garri. Spokesperson for Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said: “The driver of the Mazda bus loaded with garri lost control as a result of speeding and rammed into a runaway truck from the rear, leading to multiple hits by other vehicles.” According to him, the three persons who died in the crash included two male occupants of the Mazda bus loaded with garri, while a pregnant woman was in the Mazda bus loaded with tomatoes.” The victims, Akinbiyi said, were evacuated by FRSC officials to Idera Private Morgue, Sagamu, while TRACE officials cleared the road for traffic. He added that all the vehicles involved had been towed to Sagamu police divisional headquarters. The corps commiserated with the families of the dead, warning motorists to desist from excessive speeding. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
