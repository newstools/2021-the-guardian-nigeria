She was 65-years-old. A representative confirmed Banes’ death to Entertainment Tonight: “We are heartsick over Lisa’s tragic and senseless passing. “She was a woman of great spirit, kindness and generosity and dedicated to her work, whether on stage or in front of a camera and even more so to her wife, family and friends. We were blessed to have had her in our lives.” Banes was on her way to meet her wife Kathryn Kranhold for a dinner party when she was mowed down by a red and black scooter on June 4 on West 64th and Amsterdam Avenue, the New York Post reported. She suffered a traumatic brain injury and was unable to recover. An NYPD spokesperson said Monday night that no arrests have been made in the case. The scooter was last seen going northbound on Amsterdam Avenue. Lisa Banes | Image: Jason Merritt/Getty Images Banes studied acting at the Juilliard School in New York City.
