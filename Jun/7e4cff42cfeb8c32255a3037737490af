 [FILES] NSCDC. Photo: CURRENTSCHOOLNEWS  The Guardian learnt that the deceased driver was carrying passengers on the Ada George Road in Obio/Akpor Council of the state when a vehicle conveying the task force officials attempted to over take him, but he resisted and maintained his lane. Eyewitnesses explained that in the process of struggling to overtake him, the task force operatives hit the commercial bus driver. An eyewitness, Agnes Akpan, told newsmen that the driver, whose name was not ascertained as at the time of filing this story, blocked the task force vehicle with his car and insisted that they fix it. “The driver further called on some of his colleagues, who immediately joined him to demand repairs of his vehicle, but as the task force and NSCDC officials refused to accede to their demand, an NSCDC operative, who was trapped in the pandemonium shot the driver and continued shooting sporadically in the air to scare the rampaging drivers,” she said. She added that the NSCDC official escaped as the drivers scampered for safety following his gunshots, just as The Guardian learnt that the driver died while being taken to the hospital. The death of the driver caused serious pandemonium in the area, as an angry commercial bus driver reinforced and blocked the NTA/Mgbuoba road for several hours, making it impossible for vehicles to pass. When contacted, the state Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident, saying: “I am aware that an NSCDC officer attached to the Rivers State Task Force shot a commercial bus driver, but calm has returned to the area, as our men have been mobilised to return normalcy.” But efforts to contact the spokesman of NSCDC, Oguntuase Michael, was futile as he failed to respond to his calls and a WhatsApp message sent to his mobile telephone line as at the time of filing this story.
