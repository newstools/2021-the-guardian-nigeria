 Director-General of NITDA, Dr. Vincent Olatunji,:PHOTOS: technologytimes.ng  Olatunji said between when the policy was launched and now, the contribution of this sector to GDP is over 14.7 per cent as compared to less than four per cent years back, which is the new trend globally “and we cannot, as a country say we don’t want to go through that route because there is little we can depend on oil because it will get to a stage that the oil will finish. If you tie this to what we have done on NDPR, you will be amazed.
   
“For instance, between when we started implementing NDPR and now, we have created a market, and economy on its own that is worth over N5.2 billion, and this sector has employed over 2,600, which was within 30 months of implementing it. 
    
“Why we have achieved this much is the fact that we are working with the private sector organization to ensure the implementation of the regulation because it is one thing to have a policy and regulation, it is another thing for it to be successfully implemented. We have licensed three firms in this area. The NDPR is directly under pillar one.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
