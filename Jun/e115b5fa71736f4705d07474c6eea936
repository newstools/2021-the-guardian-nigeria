The FCT Health and Human Services secretariat say that the second batch of COVID-19 vaccines will arrive in July. The acting Secretary of the secretariat, Dr Muhammed Kawu, made the disclosure at a news conference on Thursday in Abuja to commemorate this year’s World Health Day. Kawu urged residents, particularly those in the suburbs, to get themselves tested and vaccinated against COVID-19 so as to break the chain of transmission within the territory. He said that while more than 132,000 residents had successfully taken the first jab, only 42,000 others had so far taken the second jab of the vaccine. “For the first dose, 132,000 people got vaccinated. As of June 16, about 42,000 people had gotten the second dose. “We still have up to the middle of July to finish the second dose vaccination. “We are, therefore, appealing to all those who have gotten their first dose to come out and take the second dose,” he said. The acting secretary further said that COVID-19 could be controlled by following appropriate guidelines and observing the change in lifestyle, thereby creating a fairer and healthier world. He assured that the FCT Public Health Department, through its health promotion and education unit, would continue to intensify efforts at sensitising residents on the fundamentals of getting protected against COVID-19. Earlier, the acting Director, Public Health, Dr Abdulrahman Sadiq, said that the FCT administration was putting in place measures that would sustain the fight against COVID-19. Sadiq said that all the general hospitals in the territory had COVID-19 vaccination centres. According to him, efforts are still ongoing to designate some health facilities across the six area councils as COVID-19 vaccination centres.
