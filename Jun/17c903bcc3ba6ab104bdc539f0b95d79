The governor also urged Nigerians to stop asking President Muhammadu Buhari to initiate the process of restructuring the nation. According to him, “We need to understand the nitty-gritty of our democracy and our responsibilities in office. President Buhari has no powers to amend the constitution. It is the responsibility of our parliament to amend. For instance, our people are calling for restructuring. We must stop the blame game. We must begin to understand where and when politics stops.” Uzodinma called for dialogue and a robust debate to avoid violence and insurrection. He also appealed for a “peaceful, and transparent process”, urging the committee to be vocal and give equal opportunity to contributors.

Disclosing the position of Abia, he said the establishment of state police, and restructuring was imperative. The state also demanded increased fiscal allocation to take care of revenues coming to the sub-national government.In his welcome address, Wase promised that the committee would do an acceptable job, urging the presenters to feel free to make their submissions.
