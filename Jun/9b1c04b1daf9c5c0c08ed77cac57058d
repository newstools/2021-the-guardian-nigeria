Sophos, in the survey titled “The IT Security Team: 2021 and Beyond”, which showed how increased security challenges during the pandemic offered IT teams a unique opportunity to build their cybersecurity expertise, observed that the vast majority of IT teams in Nigeria that faced a rise in cyberattacks (87 per cent) and a heavier security workload (91 per cent) over the course of 2020, strengthened their security skills and knowledge.
    
The report stated that despite the challenges created by the pandemic, 52 per cent of the IT teams surveyed globally, said team morale increased during 2020.
   
The increase in cyberattacks during the pandemic impacted IT security skills across all industry sectors covered in the survey, including, at a global level, education (83 per cent), retail (85 per cent) and healthcare (80 per cent). The survey polled 5,400 IT decision makers in mid-sized organizations in 30 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.  All respondents were from organizations with between 100 and 5,000 employees.
