 Lalong  The President of Mushere Youth Movement (MUYOM), Duwan Kutsokot, made the appeal at a press conference recently after an emergency meeting of the movement at Government Secondary School, Ikengwakap, Mushere. Kutsokot said the meeting was convened to strategise and come up with a solution to some challenges in Mushere nation.
MUYOM decried a situation where some persons in Mushere hijacked the system, playing God and creating imbalance. It cited Kawel village, for over 27 years, had no substantive head. The association also lamented that the absence of substantive traditional leaders worsened insecurity in parts of the state. “We are surprised by the involvement of some intruders in the selection/election of the Mushere traditional ruler, an affair that is purely the responsibility of the kingmakers, as clearly expressed to the world by Governor Lalong, the Chairman of Northern States Governors’ Forum during the burial of the late Ujah of Anaguta at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium, Jos. “Can our governor speak in multiple colours when he openly frowned on any individual, group or tier of government bent on interfering with the selection process, which is purely the affair of kingmakers,” it said. The group noted that the kingmakers and their source of existence could never come through political process or influenced by any politician. “We have a letter at our disposal indicating the suspension of the Mushere Kingmakers by the acting Saf Ron/​Kulere of Bokkos Local Council.” The Youths beg to know if the said brazen act is known by the acting Miskhakam Mushere, Mushere traditional council members, title-holders and other Mushere elite? “This singular threat to Mushere custom and tradition is another early warning signal of setting Mushere nation into conflict that may escalate beyond control,” they added.
