They might not regard or patronise a brand with no clearly defined purpose because they see brand purpose as an essential factor when deciding to purchase a product or service. Business magnate and investor Sir Richard Branson agrees with this, famously noting: “the brands that will thrive in the coming years are the ones that have a purpose beyond profit.” Brand purpose is a brand’s reason for being apart from making money. It connects with consumers on a more emotional level; it is about product-led initiatives which strive to achieve business objectives and benefit society simultaneously. For instance, Edelman’s 2017 Earned Brand Study found that 50 per cent of consumers worldwide consider themselves belief-driven buyers.  67 per cent bought a brand for the first time because they agreed with its position on a controversial topic. A 2018 Accenture Strategy Research Report entitled ‘From me to we: The rise of the purpose-led brand’ also found that consumers are not just making their choices based on product selection or price. “They are assessing what a brand says, what it does, and what it stands for. They support companies whose brand purpose aligns with their beliefs. And they reject those that don’t, with one in five walking away forever.” Brand purpose, the report further noted, “is the foundation of every experience, the underlying essence that makes a brand relevant and necessary.” At 9mobile, we pride ourselves as a customer-friendly company, and it is not just an empty boast. It is empirical because we walk our talk. Our brand purpose is to enable Nigerians — individuals and businesses — to achieve their full potential through our array of innovative products and services. As a truly Nigerian brand, we embody the authentic Naija spirit helping us connect with our customers to understand their needs and serve them in the most meaningful and personalised ways. Since entering the Nigerian market over a decade ago, people have always been the centrepiece of our activities and propositions. By making our customers’ challenges and well-being our purpose, we have built an army of loyalists across Nigeria. With our innovative products and services that empower customers to achieve their full potential, we have become indispensable to many Nigerians; and with excellence as the gold bar of our operations, our products and services fulfil our brand purpose—enabling Nigerians to achieve their full potentials. We are committed to running a network that delivers high-quality voice and data services through consistent investment in infrastructure to boost businesses and individuals. 9mobile recognises that Micro, Small, and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) are critical enablers of socio-economic growth; hence we strive to remove constraints on their path. Some of the limitations include lack of financial support, limited access to the market, poor corporate governance, and lack of training and experience. We have empowered them with essential knowledge and strategies to nurture their businesses through initiatives including Morebusiness 2.0. that addresses their immediate telecommunications needs by offering an all-in-one (voice and data) package at a pocket-friendly price. We reach out to SME clusters in various parts of the country to know and understand their business. After this, we provide them with the best tailor-made enterprise solutions to suit their business needs. 9mobile has also been committed to driving digital and mobile financial services for subscribers’ comfort. Some of our mobile financial services helping to drive financial inclusion and access in the country include Migo, an instant cash loan service, and MoreCredit for airtime loans. 9pay, in partnership with Google, enables seamless payments for applications on the google play store, with customers able to purchase apps from the play store using 9pay without a debit card. Apart from the mobile financial services, 9mobile also has innovative digital products, services, and solutions like DCB, Cloud9, and games that entertain millions of Nigerians. There are also innovative data packages that enable data-reliant businesses and individuals to do more through reliable and consistent internet. Moreblaze allows subscribers to enjoy a much more productive and faster online browsing experience. The mobile broadband data portfolio enables subscribers to choose their preferred data plan and do more through a reliable, consistent, and superfast internet connection. Morelife enables customers’ stay in touch with their friends and family locally and internationally without worrying about expensive call rates. We also have Moreflex plus, an all-in-one package that offers unbeatable value through its unique bundled voice and data resources. At 9mobile, we offer customers the best quality of experience by investing in Customer Experience Management solutions to measure actual user experience and better understand the customer journey.
