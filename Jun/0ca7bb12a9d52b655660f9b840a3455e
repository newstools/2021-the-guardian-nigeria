“How to cure BED-WETTING Naturally,” begins a message posted on Facebook in Nigeria in March 2021. It claims a mixture of egg, black seed oil and milk is a “very effective” cure for bedwetting in adults. “When we say cure for bed-wetting, we are only referring to bed-wetting in adults or grown up people and not kids. It’s very necessary to make this clear.” The post then described how the concoction is prepared and used. We checked if this mixture stops the condition in adults.  We spoke to an urologist about this claim. Urology is a branch of medicine that focuses on conditions related to the male and female urinary tracts and the male reproductive organs. “In medical practice, we prefer the use of scientifically tested and proven remedies,” Paul Ekwere, a professor of urology at the University of Calabar, told Africa Check. Ekwere added that many things could cause bedwetting in an adult. “My advice to adults battling with bedwetting is to visit a urologist. The expert would find out the factors triggering the issue. In most cases, bedwetting in adults has more than one cause.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
