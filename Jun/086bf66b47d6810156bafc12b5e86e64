 [FILES] Ortom  They took the decision yesterday at a joint security meeting in Takum before security chiefs, traditional rulers and chairmen of the two local councils. Chairman of Takum, who hosted the meeting, Shiban Tikari, said his local council noted with sadness the cross-border insecurity between the two councils; hence the need to checkmate the ugly scenario. He cited the incessant kidnapping, armed robbery and killings, among other vices, in Takum, which he said had become a threat to the people plying the road. Wondering why the killings, kidnapping, armed robbery do not occur in other communities except the Tiv settlements, he beckoned the Tiv leaders to desist from shielding criminals in their midst. On his part, the Chairman of Katsina-Ala, Avalumun Atera, who vowed not to cease from exposing perpetrators of crimes in his domain despite numerous threats to his life, urged the Fulani to bury the hatchet and not retaliate recent attacks by suspected Tiv militias. He enjoined the Fulani to, as well, warning their youths from indulging in acts capable of truncating the already achieved peace in the areas. The security chiefs at the meeting, including the leadership of Operation Whirl Stroke and the police, pointed at the Tiv youths as the ones perpetrating crimes in the areas. Accepting to give peace a chance, Tiv and Fulani representatives urged security operatives not to rest on their oars, pending the annihilation of the perpetrators and their sponsors. They urged the traditional rulers to go home and caution their subjects, especially the youth.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
