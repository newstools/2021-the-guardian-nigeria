Photo: Twitter Hapoel Jerusalem of Israel goalkeeper and former Nigeria youth international, Adebayo Adeleye, is so confident in his goalkeeping abilities and believes it is only a matter of time before he gets a much-awaited call-up to the Super Eagles. In an interview with The Guardian at Lagos’ Agege Stadium, the 22-year-old indicated unequivocally that he plans to increase his efforts to win Gernot Rohr’s heart. Despite admitting that the Super Eagles now have great goalkeepers who are doing incredibly well at their respective clubs, most notably Maduka Okoye, Daniel Akpeyi, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, and Francis Uzoho, Adebayo believes his prospects of playing for Nigeria are good. “The Super Eagles currently parade good goalkeepers, but I’m going to work hard to get a call-up from coach Gernot Rohr,” said Adebayo, who played a key role in steering Hapoel Jerusalem back to the Israeli top division with a string of sterling performances. He could join a small but highly-rated list of gifted Nigerian goalkeepers who used the Israeli top division as a launchpad for their career overseas. The list includes the likes of former Super Eagles stars Vincent Enyeama, Dele Aiyenugba and Austin Ejide. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
