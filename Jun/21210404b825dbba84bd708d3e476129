A three-storey building in Ajegunle, in the Apapa area of Lagos, has collapsed but occupants escaped death. The building, located at 16, Olufiditi Street, Off Safejo/Alaba Road, Alaba, Ajegunle, was said to be under construction and housing about 16 construction workers when it collapsed at about 2:00a.m. on Sunday.
  
It was gathered that workers, who were sleeping beneath the structure, fled as the foundation began to shake before it collapsed.
 
A resident, Bayo Kassim, told The Guardian that the owner was notified of the condition of the building, but he ignored the warning.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
