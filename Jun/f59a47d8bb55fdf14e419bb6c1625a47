 Bigdreamz  And this he tried to shed light on in his new single, Not For Fashion, as he brings his full elements to play. Since the release of the song, positive reviews from every corner have come his way, but the singer said he dreams of getting bigger than where he currently occupies in the minds of his fans. Bigdreamz says he dreams big and aims higher with every song that comes from him, describing his music as timeless and soul-lifting.
