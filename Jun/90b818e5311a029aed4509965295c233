 Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of IXPN, Muhammed Rudman, said the activation of Verisign’s RIR Site into IXPN physical infrastructure is a pointer to the company’s mission.  Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN) presently covers eight Points of Presence (PoPs) in Nigeria; four in Lagos and a branch each in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu, and Kano. The Lagos PoPs are all interconnected to each other with high-capacity links and with full redundancy. To promote even growth for local Internet traffic across the country, the Nigeria Communications Commission provided the connectivity between Lagos and the other four branches in the country.
   
Also, as part of efforts to improve performance, services, and scalability which is critical in today’s evolving Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, IXPN last year acquired Switches capable of 25Gbps, 40Gbps, and 100Gbps ports capacity for its entire network in Lagos. The essence of upgrading the switches is to help the company address the current and anticipated needs of its growing customer base.
