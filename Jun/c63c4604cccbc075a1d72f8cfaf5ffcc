Here are some quick tips to keep in mind when dressing for rainy weather or dealing with unpredictable weather in general. Omoni Oboli Photo – @Libartyartstudios Invest In Rain Boots
No matter the outfit you are wearing, throwing on knee-high boots is not only stylish but will keep you dry. It especially goes well with skinny jeans. Victoria Kimani Photo – @tintseh Consider A Scarf
Protect your hair with a scarf during the rainy days. A thin scarf to tie around your hair can keep flyaways at bay and protect against frizz. Style influencer Saufeeya Goodson in boots and beanie _ Photo- Savoir Flair Layer Your Outfit
The weather can be tricky and unpredictable so to avoid being caught unawares, it is advised that you layer your outfit in case of a sudden change of weather. If rain is on the radar then layer your outfit so that you can ditch outer layers if it suddenly gets warm and dry or to keep yourself warm in case the weather takes a turn for the worst. SeyiShay A Pop Of Colours
Just because the skies are grey does not mean that you have to wear dull colours. Brighten up your day by adding a pop of colour to your outfits. It won’t be a bad idea to add a pop of colour like red, yellow or blue. If you don’t like bold colours, you can lighten things up with muted colours.
