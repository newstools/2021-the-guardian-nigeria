Telecommunications service provider, MTN, has assured its teeming customers in Nigeria of improved services. Reacting to a news story (Not The Guardian), yesterday, which claimed that it (MTN) had raised the alarm that it could not guarantee stable services due to the level of insecurity in the country, the telecoms firm described the report as misleading. Checks showed that MTN currently has 74.8 million customers and 39 per cent market share in Nigeria. In a statement, MTN said it is aware of misleading media coverage related to a notice sent to a select group of its enterprise customers on June 15, about potential service disruptions. To clarify the issue Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria, said: “Maintaining network stability and high levels of customer service remains a key priority for us. “In line with MTN’s standard practice, this includes communicating to and informing customers of any potential disruptions in a timely manner, whether due to maintenance on the network, outages due to faults or other circumstances that may pose a risk, enabling them to plan appropriately and put in place business continuity measures.” Toriola said the notice in question was a routine notification to a small group of businesses affected by a specific challenge in very few specific locations. He stressed that these notices are regularly distributed to partners and are not out of the ordinary. According to him, small, medium and large enterprises are key to driving economic growth in Nigeria, and with the rise of digital solutions, are becoming more reliant on secure and reliable connectivity solutions. He said: “We recognise and understand the importance of service availability and strive to deliver a seamless and uninterrupted high-quality network experience, so that they are able to meet their customer’s needs.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
