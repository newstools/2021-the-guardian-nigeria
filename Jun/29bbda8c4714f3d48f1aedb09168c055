The Edo State Police Command yesterday said it would rely on the advice of Director of the Public Prosecution (DPP) as it continues investigation into the alleged murder of a 79-year-old Osariakhi Oronsaye by his 13-year-old son, Abubakar. The Public Relations Officer in the Edo State command, Kontongs Bello, said the killing happened at Egbon Estate in Evbuotubu, Benin, Edo State, on Sunday. He said the minor status of the offender had made it imperative for the command to liaise with the DPP, adding that everything would be done to unravel the case. “I can confirm to you that the command is discussing the case with the DPP. It is an unfortunate case but we are also conducting our investigation to ensure that we unravel the case. “The culprit is a minor, so we must be sure of what we are doing,” the PPRO stated. The Guardian learned that Oronsaye had, earlier, reported his son to the Evbuotubu Police Station a week ago but pleaded with them to leave the boy alone. However, the young boy carried out his threat as he allegedly axed his father to death in his sleep in the early hours of Sunday. Some family members interviewed described the incident as tragic. A family member said: “We have not known Abubakar to be having a mental problem, but we are shocked by his actions now.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
