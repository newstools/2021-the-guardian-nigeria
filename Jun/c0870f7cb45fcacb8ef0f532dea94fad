The school located 12, Takum Close, Area 11 Garki, a highbrow area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), runs a British/Nigeria academic curriculum and leadership courses “that expose the students to a complete circle of training and development”. The school, with a world-class hostel facility, has qualified teaching and non-teaching staff, including renowned British and African scholars. Addressing selected journalists in Abuja ahead of the official opening of the college, the Proprietress, Uloma Nwosu Rochas, said the idea of the school is to bring back culture to the educational system, “where it is not just about education but character and culture.” According to her, “the Aretean is set to breed a whole new generation of leaders by reinforcing the need for responsibility, character and intelligence”. She disclosed that the school is affiliating with some renowned colleges in the UK and will be carrying out exchange programmes. Former Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, described it as an impactful initiative that will produce a complete African child that will provide leadership that will propel the continent to global reckoning. The first African female president noted further that education is about the only tool that can liberate and lift up Africa, adding that the idea of impacting leadership skills in students in early years will ensure the emergence of great leaders that can compete with their contemporaries across the world.
