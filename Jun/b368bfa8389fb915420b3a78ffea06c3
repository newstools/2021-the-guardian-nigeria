 UTME  Some candidates who sat for the UTME had blamed their inability to make good grades on being given the wrong syllabus. But Head, Public Affairs and Protocol of JAMB, Fabian Benjamin, in a statement said: “The truth of the matter is that all Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) questions are based on texts prescribed for the UTME in its syllabus. The Board ordinarily would not have reacted to the half-truth being peddled by some disgruntled candidates, who were ill-prepared for the examination and who, true to all expectations, performed below the expectations of their guardians, that the Board had based its questions on the wrong syllabus.” He said, to ensure that its syllabus was accessible to all candidates sitting its examination, the Board made the material available on three platforms. The platforms are the Board’s Integrated Brochure and Syllabus System (IBASS); the CD, which was given to candidates after completion of registration; and the link https://www.ibass.jamb.gov.ng. as provided with the candidates’ profile code.
