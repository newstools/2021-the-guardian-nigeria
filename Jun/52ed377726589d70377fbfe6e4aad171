Students of the Rivers State College of Health Science and Management Technology, yesterday staged a peaceful protest for alleged neglect by the state government.
 
The angry students, who barricaded the  Ikwerre road by  Agip junction, alleged that they have not taken their baths for one week  as a result of lack of electricity which consequently affected their water supply and sanitary systems.
 
Brandishing placards with inscriptions  such as; No water, our classrooms are dilapidated as if we don’t pay fees, unconducive learning environment, this kind school-nawaoo’, the students alleged that governor, Nyesom Wike, abandoned them but was busy giving attention to other higher institutions in the state.
 
Some of the students in an interview said, “We are on protest because we don’t have light. We pay hostel fees yet we don’t have  water to bathe, no light to iron our uniforms, infections are  everywhere because we have  not washed our bathrooms for several weeks. The situation is tensed and we are not happy”  “We need at least 1000 kV generator, our classrooms are too small likewise the staff rooms, the small internally generated revenue is used  to pay our part-time lecturers, so the school needs help”
 
Contacted, the spokesman for the Rivers State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, assured that the police in the state would continue to provide  peaceful  and habitable environment for the citizens.
 
“We are more than  prepared to ensure that laws and orders are maintained but for the protesters, we insist  that people should ensure that the rights of others are not infringed while demonstrating, its wrong to block the roads, when people go against the law, that’s when the  police will come after them but we are in to maintain peace,” Omoni assured.
