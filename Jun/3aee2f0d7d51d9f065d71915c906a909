 Marriage.<br />PHOTO: google.com/search  This, according to it, will put a stop to early marriage among female citizens in Nigeria. CAN President, Olasupo Ayokunle, said this, yesterday while presenting the position of CAN before the Constitution Review Committee for the South-West Zone in Akure Centre. Ayokunle, who was represented by the Ondo State CAN Chairman, John Oladapo, lamented that the girl-child had been exposed to series of indecent tradition and circumstances. Aside the myriad of child abuse against the girl-child, he said it would also avail the female folk to maximally explore inclusiveness and participation in all spheres of her growth to adulthood. “We recommend that the constitution shall bring clarity and emphasis to recognising and affirming 18 years as the age of maturity and that for sexual consent,” he said.
