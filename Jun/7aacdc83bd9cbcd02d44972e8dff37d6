Nwachukwu said that troops of 152 Task Force Battalion in conjunction with Air Component, eliminated the terrorists on Sunday while attempting to infiltrate the Forward Operational Base at Bula Yobe.

He said the wounded solders were evacuated to a medical facility for medical attention.

Faruk Yahaya, has lauded the Land troops and the Air Component for their collaboration and quick response, which is in tandem with the ongoing rejigging of the counter terrorism counter insurgency operations in the North East. “He charged the troops to maintain the tempo and vehemently hold their ground, to deny the terrorists freedom of action,” Nwachukwu said.
