Edo State has attained a milestone in the management of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, recording no new deaths in the last 11 weeks, and no fresh infection in 12 days. The state’s COVID-19 Incident Manager, Dr. Andrew Obi, who disclosed this yesterday in Benin City, said Edo was one of the first states to record zero active cases in the second wave of the pandemic. Noting that the state has commenced administering the second dose on eligible persons, Obi urged those who took the first dose to make themselves available for the second jabs. He said the state vaccinated over 38,000 eligible persons across its 18 local councils, including health workers, strategic leaders and other frontline workers during the first phase. Obi said decontamination of homes and offices of infected persons, contact tracing and line listing activities, strict enforcement of preventive protocols and vaccination were part of efforts to contain the virus. MEANWHILE, Governor Godwin Obaseki has said the fate of the 14 members-elect of the House of Assembly, whose seats were declared vacant, rests with the court. The seats were in December 2019 declared vacant by then Speaker Francis Okiye for being absent from the House’s proceedings for the mandatory 181 days. The governor, while reacting to calls to pardon the erring lawmakers during an interactive session with stakeholders from the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other civil society groups, called for the support of all towards achieving lasting peace and development in Edo. In his remarks, state NLC chairman, Sunday Osanyande, urged the current administration to digitise revenue collection with a view to checking leakages. He said e-revenue would further increase the state’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
