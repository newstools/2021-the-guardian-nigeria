According to him, security operatives are also human beings who require support by way of information from communities to be able to deal with the challenge. Fielding questions from newsmen after he met separately with Buhari and his Chief of Staff (CoS), Ibrahim Gambari, the governor highlighted the need for collaboration to stem banditry. “Yes, we urge vigilance and support for security agencies. Security agencies are doing a great job, but they are also human beings. They need a lot of support. They need a lot of community support for information and understanding because, sometimes, we are all in a hurry when we are facing challenges. But the security agencies also have modus operandi. “Sometimes, they get risk reports in places that 500 people are coming to attack and maybe the local Divisional Police Officer (DPO) can only mobilise 20 people. Already, that confronts him with a challenge,” he said. On the meeting with the President, Bagudu said he was in the State House, Abuja, to brief Buhari, among other issues, on some security issues in his state. His words: “The President promptly issued a statement and sent condolence messages and support. I appreciated him on behalf of the people of Kebbi. “Just last week, there was an unfortunate attack by bandits from neighbouring states that claimed a number of people in Kebbi.” Bagudu said his meeting with the CoS centred principally on food security.
