Nigeria’s problem with leadership is no longer news. So, has the most basic of advancement in human evolution, the quest for a good life for all, or at least, a decent percentage of the populace remained elusive.  Successive leaders, from military to democratic governance have come and gone with no clear or satisfactory governance style or ideals in physical or economic development, political economy, or socio-economic framework. The political parties just as government so far, have failed to demonstrate or visibly adopt any ideology.
 
The absence of any clear or known governance style distillable from successive governments is a major setback posing grave concerns. This is because no traditions or culture have emerged or been established nor is one identifiable from which present generation can glean a process of commonality of action for the common good or for succeeding generations to draw some standards. This difficulty has remained since at least, the last fifty years. The period of computation is not drawn from the time of independence, since so much stand in the credit of the first generation of national leaders.
 
The basic aim of governance is to aspire to and establish a just society. A just society is a society typified by visible respect of the rights and liberties of members. A just society is premised on satisfactory indices of a tranquil orderliness. Achieving a just society engages four main principles: rationality, minimum moral standard, fairness, and equality. On rationality, the vessel of governance must engage the members of society, and aim at understanding human nature and society, with a well-established process for logical evaluation of evidence emerging from experience.  They do not believe that there is any skill necessary to be a navigator, and believe they are all qualified. Adeimantus concedes to Socrates that the real navigator would be called “an idle babbler”.
 
We thus, see that democracies in other jurisdictions are conceived in measured steps and that the electorates and patterns of election are different for different stages of engagement of holders of offices- from the legislature to the executive. In the United States of America, aside from the general electorates there is the electoral college and in parliamentary systems, the head of government emerges from the party structure. The monarchical institutions have somewhat similar structures since the members are trained and equipped with necessary moral ethics, candour and sundry paraphernalia of such institutions.
 
The question then is what the difference is, between the present pattern of electing a President for Nigeria’s democracy and the proposal by Adefarasin. He is holding the political parties as we know them today, to a higher standard than they have ever been known for, which may equate to nothing other than the legal maxim nemo dat quod non habet. It must, however, be said that Adefarasin has provided a working guideline for the prerequisites for the President- we, the people would want in office, come 2023.
 
The legislature, whose committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution is currently busy, must turn its attention to an autochthonous mode of electing a suitable candidate for the office of the President of modern Nigeria. This concern needs to be broached if we must have a nation and leave a legacy of this geographical and political space.
