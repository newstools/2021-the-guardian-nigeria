According to Ajayi-Kadir, the reported 3.40 per cent GDP growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, given the numerous challenges facing the sector. We are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs, so it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 and 0.43 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 which were relatively stable periods. “Incidentally, there is no recorded high level of economic activities in the sector that would justify such a growth rate in the quarter.  Even the aggregate MCCI which increased to 49.1 points in the first quater of 2021 from 42.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2020 was still below the 50 neutral base points, which indicated that manufacturers only have a little more confidence in the economy”, he added.
