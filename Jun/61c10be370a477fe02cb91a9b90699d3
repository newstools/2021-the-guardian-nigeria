The South-South Presidency 2023 Advocacy Group has canvassed for a president of South-South extraction come 2023 for fairness, peace and to enable the region to complete its tenure, after the involuntary exit of former President Goodluck Jonathan. The group, which backed the position of the Southern and Middle Belt leasers, stressed that no South-South politician should accept the vice presidential candidate or chairman of any political party. It made this known at a media briefing while presenting its communiqué after its meeting in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. Coordinator of the group, Ini Ekong Charles Udonwa, who presented its position, said President Muhammadu Buhari had done his best in ensuring Nigeria remained self-sufficient in rice production and in most of the edible agricultural products, and as such, cost savings in foreign exchange. He expressed satisfaction with government’s efforts in pursuing a tentative solution to kidnappings through the introduction of National Identity Number (NIN) Registration. Udonwa also argued that the South-South region had ensured that the zone remained peaceful under which the present administration thrived, coupled with co-existence leadership, which he said, sustained President Buhari’s development strides. He advocated that all regions of the country should allow the South-South region to reclaim the presidency in 2023, adding that other regions lacked capacity, leadership and solution to the country’s problem. The group maintained that other regions had not provided the Buhari administration a peaceful mandate, as clearly manifested in the agitations, uprising and violence in the South East, West, Middle belt and Northern Nigeria. Udonwa added that the group had positioned itself as a viable political platform in the geopolitical region, including all ethnic groups, irrespective of their political affiliations, to ensure the push for the presidency in 2023. It, therefore, urged the National Assembly to create a platform that would enable Nigerians to get a people’s constitution that would allow for fiscal federalism and homegrown democratic governance structure. The group urged the Federal Government to urgently inaugurate a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to enable it achieve its objectives and purpose for which it was established, and sustain the prevailing peace in the region. It expressed concern over the underdevelopment of the Niger Delta, when compared to its contribution to the Federation Account and overall economy. “We are also worried about rising insecurity in the country and urge the President, National Assembly, security agencies, traditional and religious leaders and all Nigerians to contribute in addressing issues that have caused and ignited the current situation to secure the country’s sovereignty, while protecting life and property of Nigerians,” the communiqué added.
