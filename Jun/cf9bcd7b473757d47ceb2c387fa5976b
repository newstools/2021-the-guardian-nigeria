Again, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has ruled out the possibility of anointing anybody as its flagbearer in the forthcoming Anambra governorship poll. The APC’s Caretaker Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, stated this when Dr. George Moghalu submitted his Expression of Interest Form at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, assuring all those angling for the governorship ticket a level-playing field at the primary election. He said: “The party will ensure that a level-playing ground is provided for all the aspirants at the forthcoming party’s primary. We have no anointed candidate. The party will work with whoever emerges at the primary election. “In line with the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, we are committed to working with all. That is why we need all to join hands with the party by ensuring that Anambra State joins the progressives come November 6, 2021 at the forthcoming state governorship election.” Moghalu, who fielded questions from reporters, said it would be in the best interest of the party if the aspirants agree on a consensus candidate. He, however, expressed readiness to slug it out with his rivals at the primary election in the absence of a consensus candidate.
