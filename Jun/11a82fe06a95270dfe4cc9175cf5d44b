Ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games, which begins next month, the Japanese Nippon Badminton Association (NBA) has donated rackets to the Badminton Federation Of Nigeria (BFN) to help the country’s badminton squad in their preparation and participation in the Games. The Japanese Ambassador to Nigeria, Matsunaga Kazuyoshi, made the presentation in Abuja yesterday at the BFN Secretariat, Package B of MKO Abiola Stadium. Speaking at the presentation, Kazuyoshi, who is performing his first official assignment in sports after assuming duties over a month ago, presented 80 badminton rackets to the BFN leadership, pledging his embassy’s support to Nigeria’s quest to win medals in the badminton event at the Games. “I am happy to be at this special occasion today. Of course, most exciting is the fact that Nigeria is participating in the badminton event at the Olympics in the Men’s and Women’s Singles. Our desire is to support Nigeria’s team to the Olympic Games in Japan and ensuring effective and successful participation in all the events qualified for at the Games. “I am also looking forward to seeing Ms. Eniola Bolaji at the World Para Badminton Championship in Japan this October. She has made history as the first Nigerian and African to win gold medal at the 2021 Spanish Para Badminton International Championship,” Kazuyoshi said. Reacting at the presentation, the Chairman, Caretaker Committee of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN), Francis Obih, commended the NBA and the Japanese Embassy for their kind gesture, adding that the rackets will help the federation in preparation and successful participation at the Tokyo Olympic Games. “Today is a very special day for the badminton family in Nigeria. We want to say a big thank you to the Japanese Ambassador and the NBA for the generous donation,” Obih said. The elated Obih disclosed that for the first time Nigeria has qualified for the Olympics in the men’s doubles event, saying that the Federation has returned to the Olympic Games after 12 years of absence.
