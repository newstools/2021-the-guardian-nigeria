The Joint operatives of the Imo State Police Command, at the weekend, stormed camps of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN), arresting the commander, wounding several of them in a gun duel and recovering several arms/weapons and charms. In a statement, yesterday, by the Media Adviser to the Commissioner of Police in the state, Michael Abattam, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said the commander of the group provided tips that led to the discovery of the camps. The camps are located in Izombe, Oguta Council, Atta in Ikeduru Council and Ideato North Council. Abattam, in a chat with The Guardian, said the apprehended commander was under investigation, adding that the command would not disclose his name until later. His words: “You know it is under investigation. There are certain things we don’t want to let out now. We will give you in due course.” The statement read: “On 25/6/2021, at about 0400hrs following the arrest of IPOB/ESN kingpin/commander, who after interrogation, gave useful information about their camps and activities and led the Police Tactical Units comprising of Imo Command Tactical Units, IRT and Special Forces teams to the three IPOB/ ESN Terrorist Camps located at Atta in Ikeduru Council, Izombie in Oguta Council and Ideato North Council in Imo State. “On sighting the tactical teams approaching their camp, the hoodlums opened fire at them hence, there was heavy exchange of gunfire. But, due to the superior firing power of the Police, the hoodlum was overrun by the Tactical Units. While some of them escaped with bullets wounds into the forest. Several weapons, stolen cars, explosives, gunpowder, charms, lPOB/ESN flags, ammunitions, bags of Indian Hemps, Tramadol tablets and many other hard drugs were recovered.” The statement said the CP, Abutu Yaro, commended the officers, urging them to maintain the tempo.
