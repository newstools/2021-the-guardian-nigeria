FBN Holdings (FBNH) Plc has advised investors in the country’s capital market to seek financial advice from professionals when making investment decisions to maximise returns. The Chief Financial Officer of FBNH, Oyewale Ariyibi, said this at a knowledge-sharing session with journalists at the weekend. Ariyibi said financial advisers would help investors to identify the fundamental stocks to invest in to maximise returns on investment. “As an investor, investing in the financial market is not gamble or betting, you need a financial adviser for investment decision. “You should invest money you don’t need immediate use, invest for medium and long-term, also invest in stocks that have good fundamentals for capital gains,” Ariyibi said. Speaking on the theme: ‘Understanding Financial Statement for Business Reporting,’ he raised awareness of the value derived from the financial statement of a company. Ariyibi said: “A financial statement represents a formal record of the financial activities of an entity; it reflects the financial effects of business transactions and events on an entity. “It is prepared by following certain logical and consistent accounting principles; and it is usually audited to ensure accuracy for tax, financing, or investing purposes. “For Management, it is used for planning, controlling and decision-making process, to evaluate the organisational performance and position, so that the necessary measures are taken for improvement. “For shareholders and investors, a financial statement can be used to analyse the viability and profitability of their investments and to assess the ability of the business/organisation to pay dividends and determine any future course of action.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
