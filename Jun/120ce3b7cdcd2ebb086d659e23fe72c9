He further noted that the 68 chairpersons that went to court were not recognised under the law because the number of local councils belonging to Oyo State in the constitution of Nigeria is listed as 33. Makinde stated this while delivering a keynote address at the 2021 Governor ‘Seyi Makinde National Democracy Summit themed: ‘’The Future of Democracy in Nigeria,’’ at the International Conference Centre of the University of Ibadan (UI), Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. He said: “Let me use this opportunity to talk about a report that I read in a newspaper saying that the Oyo State Government would not obey the court order about paying the ousted local council chairmen. This is a false report and it is not representative of the views of the administration. “When we go to Joint Account Committee (JAC), they only pay us the money for 33 local councils. So, I believe when they file the affidavit of compliance, the Supreme Court needs to clarify whether its decision is restricted to paying only the 33. “Once the Supreme Court makes clarification on payment,  I will promptly pay.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
