…Experts worry over persistent migration of fund from stock market The continuous exit of funds from the equities market to another investment instrument, especially the fixed income segment has become a source of worry to capital market stakeholders, as they urged the Federal Government to tackle growing security challenges in Nigeria. The stakeholders argued that insecurity problem in Nigeria has increased investors’ apathy in the stock market as they prefer to stake their funds in the fixed market where there is some stability. They maintained that the spate of insecurity in the country is having a multiplier effect on the stock market, adding that it is a major factor responsible for the lull being witnessed in the market currently. According to them, though some of these stocks had remained attractive due to prolonged sell-off, the market has continued to witness low patronage from local investors while few foreigners are currently offloading their shares massively due to fear of losing their portfolios. The market capitalisation which stood at N21.515 trillion as at January 5, 2021, when the market reopened for transactions for the year, dropped to N19.725 trillion as at close of trading on yesterday, representing N1.8 trillion loss while the All-Share Index plunged by 3,300.32 points or 9.0 per cent from 41,147.39 to 37,847.07. The stakeholders insisted that if authorities fail to restore stability in the country, notwithstanding improved macroeconomic indicators, the soured state of the nation would erode the positive attributes of the macroeconomy with a the multiplier effect on the stock market. The Founder, Independent Shareholders Association, Sir Sunny Nwosu said investors prefer to stake their funds in the fixed market where the interest rate is fixed and stable. “Fund is leaving the market because of the current trend. A stock you bought through a rights issue at N42.00 is N23.00 today, so some people will want to have a fixed interest rate. For instance, if the interest rate is 10 per cent, you work on that and expect the 10 per cent gain, which is fixed than the capital market, which you are not sure about. “Everything about the capital market is based on performance so they may be leaving. What is the capitalisation today, a little above N11 trillion, from over N15 trillion?  This money is investors’ money and not the regulators.” The President of Ibadan Zone shareholders Association, Eric Akinduro said since investment in shares is not immune from what is happening within the economy, investors have to access more stable instruments where the safety of investment is guaranteed. He pointed out that the economy had suffered prolonged volatility, which has impacted negatively on the market. “Our economy has been volatile and investors are not ‘father Xmas’. Any unfavourable instrument will always witness the migration of investors. For instance, foreign investors are always looking for a good environment and instruments to invest in. “When it is otherwise, they move out to a better investment community. Even local investors are sceptical of what is happening. Until we get it right in this country, the economy will not improve.” At the close of transactions yesterday, the market capitalisation of listed equities declined by 1.81 per cent to N19.725 trillion from N20.089 trillion it opened on Monday, while the All-Share Index also depreciated by 698.23 basis points to 37847.07 points from 38545.30 points traded the previous day.
