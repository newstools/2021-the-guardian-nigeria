EPM Director, Aminu Kasimu, who spoke yesterday at Akwanga, Nasarawa State, reassured Nigerians that the commission was poised for a seamless exercise beginning from June 28. In his remarks, ECES representative, Wilson Manji, observed that effective communication promotes transparency and integrity for the consolidation of democracy. MEANWHILE, the People’s Life Improvement Foundation (PLIF) has deplored INEC’s non-adoption of electronic voting. Accusing the electoral umpire of speaking from both sides of the mouth, the group’s president, Chief Precious Elekima, maintained that INEC’s alleged unstable positions do not bode well for the 2023 general elections.
