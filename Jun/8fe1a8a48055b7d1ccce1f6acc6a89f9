Two All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants in the November 6, 2021 Anambra State governorship poll, Chidozie Nwankwo and Damuel Okoye, have said that incumbency factor will not determine the state’s next chief executive. While submitting his expression of interest form at the party secretariat in Abuja yesterday, Nwankwo told reporters that his pedigree alone was enough to dim APGA’s fortunes at the poll. The business mogul, who promised to provide jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the state, noted: “My reputation in Anambra is high because I have been the head of the biggest market in Onitsha, which controls all the elite decision-makers in the state’s 177 communities. I have been a leader in Onitsha Main Market for 10 years. Within the 10 years of my reign, I brought a change that cannot be erased in 100 years. “I am going to single Anambra out to become the industrial hub of Africa. Millions of youths will not have time to demonstrate when they are employed.”
Also, while submitting his expression of interest form, Okoye claimed that APGA could not withstand the over one million membership of the APC in Anambra. He added: “APGA has collapsed. In the last registration exercise, APC registered over one million members. If APGA still exists, we would not get such number. APGA died with its founder. I can assure you that nothing on earth can stop APC.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
