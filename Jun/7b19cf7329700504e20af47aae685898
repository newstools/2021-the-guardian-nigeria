Iya saidd despite the series agreement reached with the state government to pay the backlog of workers promotion allowance since 2011 till date, nothing has been done but lips service. “The present governor Abdullahi Sule when he came on board two years ago he pleaded with the Labor to be patient with him, we were patient till after two years and nothing has been done,” he said. “The past administration hinge their excuse on paucity of fund saying they only received about N2.5billion as federal allocation, now the state is receiving N4.5billion. “Governor Sule has up his security vote from N200billion to N300billion, but kept telling us that there is no money to pay arrears of workers since the past 13-14 years. “A situation where there is no promotion allowances, no annually increment, no training. Worker in the state who were employed since 2011 still receiving same salary with nothing being added till date”, Iya lamented. The TUC chairman  said that the workers in Nasarawa have suffered too long and have endured so much. He stated that the decision to embark on the Indefinite strike was a collective decision and overdue, noting that the union had exhausted all channels of dialogue. The union urged all workers in the state to comply strictly with the decision and vowed to stay at home until their demands are granted.
