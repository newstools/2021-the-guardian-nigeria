I scored,” Manchester City player De Bruyne told RTBF. “But I didn’t want to celebrate that goal. I have too much respect for the Danish fans.” The 2-1 win sends Belgium, who trailed to Yussuf Poulsen’s second-minute opener, into the knockout phase for the second straight European Championship. “We can be happy,” said De Bruyne. “We knew that there would be difficult moments against Denmark and in front of this crowd, with everything that happened.” Belgium face Finland in Saint Petersburg on Monday knowing a point would be enough to secure top spot in Group B.
