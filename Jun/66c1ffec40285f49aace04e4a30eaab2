He said: “The most important thing is for us to thank God, the Almighty Allah for His mercies. All of us are aware of what happened around the world. COVID-19 struck, even the most important countries or the so-called advanced countries like America lost over 600,000 people, China lost a lot of people. So, we must thank God and we pray for the souls that went to Nigeria, but our number was very small. “When the pandemic started, everybody in the world was afraid for Africa, that bodies would be picked on the streets, but Allah did not allow that to happen. “We must thank God for His mercies. We must thank our Imams and of course our Christian brothers because during the lockdown, we were challenged and we had meetings with our Imams and they were very forthright. They said if we needed to shut the mosque, then shut it. They did not argue, they said if it was about safety, then shut it down. So, we didn’t have any crisis. We must thank all our Imams, and may Almighty Allah continue to be with you.”
