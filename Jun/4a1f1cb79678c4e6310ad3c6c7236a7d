• Why Generation Y are shunning the stock market for Ponzi schemes, cryptocurrencies, betting
• Operators worry about losing market patronage on the exit of the older generation
• Stakeholders want decisive regulatory actions to prevent exposure to harmful schemes Despite years of stability of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, many Nigerian youths are diversifying and hedging their investment portfolios from the country’s high inflation and devaluation, through virtual currencies, online bets and international stocks.  Millennials remember the entire crisis, as well as its aftermath and the blame that stocks had in it. Erasing these from memory is not easy and millennials who are already struggling to find decent employment and competitive salaries cannot be asked to risk their savings. After the crash, millennials have become focused on their immediate needs.
 
Adonri said due to the high level of financial illiteracy in Nigeria and the penchant of youths for internet addiction, it was not difficult for cryptocurrency ventures to penetrate in Nigeria. He pointed out that Nigerians also have an unusually high appetite for taking risks with their ‘get rich quick attitude.’  In Nigeria, most FinTech-related products are sold to millennials as AgriTech funds or pure peer-to-peer lending. The more esoteric AgriTech funds involve playing in a market that allows one to lend money to farmers in parts of the country one may never visit. They promise significantly higher returns than traditional investment and offer low rates of investment loss. For risk-loving millennials, ponzi schemes are the preferred form of investing. Ponzi scheme is an investment that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. The organisers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk. According to the yearly report of the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum, which was unveiled in 2017, the Nigerian investing public lost N11.9 billion to the Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM) ponzi.
 
The apex stock market regulator, in collaboration with officials the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), had visited major newspapers and radio stations, warning innocent Nigerians of the dangers of investing in Ponzi schemes.  Acting Director of Communications of the CBN, Osita Nwanisobi, said: “Evidence now suggests that some cryptocurrencies have become more widely used as speculative assets rather than as means of payment, thus, explaining the significant volatility and variability in their prices.  He argued that it is a misconception to conclude that contemporary Nigerian youths are attracted to cryptocurrency because of their desire to get rich quickly.
 
Stockbroker and Chief Executive Officer of Sofunix Investment Limited, Sola Oni, said the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) Investor Education Policy (IEP) captured the need to bring millennials to the capital market ecosystem, as the future class of savvy investors.
 
He said the exchange is aware that any business that fails to factor millennials into its target customers is on a gradual slope to extinction. “Capital market appreciates the fact that the future of the market belongs to the youths, especially millennials and generation Y. A lot of programmes have been designed to attract these groups of future investors. They are called digital natives and all they need is for the market to be accessible digitally,” he said. With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, already, plans are afloat for the CBN to launch its digital currency before 2022. Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, revealed this last Thursday. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country’s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies. The CBN has made “tremendous progress” exploring the technology for a digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers’ Committee. The announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities to regulate the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms. Despite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
