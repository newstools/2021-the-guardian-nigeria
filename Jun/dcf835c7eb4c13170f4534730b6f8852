We are coming to restore the freedom of Nigerians, especially the youths. “This is a quit notice to Governor Benedict Ayade, he should begin to pack his load and we also know that he is regretting joining the APC because more governors are joining the 14 PDP governors from the All Progressives Congress (APC).” Secondus, who was joined by former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, former governors of Anambra and Cross River states, Peter Obi, Liyel Imoke and others, welcomed former Governor Donald Duke back to the party. They also received eight members of the State House of Assembly, who refused to follow Ayade to the APC and restated their loyalty to the PDP. Sokoto State Governor and Chairman, PDP Governors’ Forum, Aminu Tambuwal, said the party was ready to take over government at the centre in 2023, adding: “When we take over government in 2023, we will start restructuring the country.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
