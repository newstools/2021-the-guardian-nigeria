PHOTO: AFP A freight train derailed and toppled onto houses alongside the tracks in western Mexico on Tuesday, killing one resident and injuring three others, emergency services said. Two locomotives and 12 train cars overturned in the town of San Isidro Mazatepec in the state of Jalisco, the regionâ€™s civil protection and fire department said on Twitter. Efforts were under way to retrieve the body of the elderly victim from the rubble following the derailment of the lengthy train carrying canola grain. It was not immediately clear what caused the accident, which comes weeks after a metro disaster in Mexico City in which 26 people died when an overpass collapsed. Prosecutors and independent experts are investigating the causes of that tragedy.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
