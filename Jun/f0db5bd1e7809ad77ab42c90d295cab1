Ariana Grande has released a live performance video of her song “pov”. Grande, 27, teamed up with Vevo to bring her fans the “official” live recording of the track from her 2020 album ‘Positions’. Ariana’s “pov” Official Live Performance is rooted in the concept of duality, with the superstar serenading viewers under a single spotlight and purple tint while walking through a field of flowers.  “We are so excited to release these exclusive video performances to Ariana’s fans” says JP Evangelista, SVP, Content, Programming & Marketing. “We’ve loved Ariana’s music for years, and it’s been such a privilege to watch her artistry grow and evolve. An immensely creative and collaborative artist is key to these visually stunning performances and Ariana embodies that – her efforts translated beautifully onscreen. We look forward to seeing her continue to blossom and hope everyone enjoys watching these.” Vevo has previously worked with Ariana Grande in 2013 and 2016 for her “Vevo Presents” performances of “Dangerous Woman,” “Be Alright,” “Leave Me Lonely,” “Greedy” and “Into You.” Ariana was one of Vevo’s Top 10 Worldwide Most Watched Artists of 2020 and shattered the Vevo 24 Hour View Count Record in 2018 with her video for “thank u, next” with a staggering 50 million views.
