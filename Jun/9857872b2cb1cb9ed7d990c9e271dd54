Ned Beatty | Image: Kintop/Kobal/Shutterstock US actor Ned Beatty, known for his roles in “Deliverance” and “Superman”, has died at the age of 83. “Ned passed away from natural causes Sunday morning, surrounded by his family and loved ones,” his manager Deborah Miller revealed. Beatty was one of the top character actors in film, particularly during the 1970s, and appeared in more than 160 films. One of Beatty’s most iconic roles is from the 1972 film Deliverance, where he played an executive named Bobby Trippe who was forced to strip at gunpoint by two mountain men who humiliate and rape him – a scene so shocking at the time that it is still referred to as a screen milestone. “Ned is an iconic, legendary talent, as well as a dear friend, and he will be missed by us all,” his family said in a statement, The Independent reports. Born Ned Thomas Beatty in Louisville, Ky. Beatty began singing with professional gospel quartets at the age of 10. He spent the early years of his acting career at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va., followed by the Erie (Penn.) Playhouse, Houston’s Playhouse Theater and Washington, D.C.’s Arena Stage Company. Beatty appeared in four films that were nominated for the Oscar best picture award in the 1970s: “Deliverance” (1972), “Nashville” (1975), “All the President’s Men” (1976) and “Network” (1976). In addition, he voiced a character, Lotso, in 2010’s “Toy Story 3,” which was also nominated. Beatty’s last film before retirement was the comedy film Baggage Claim in 2013.
