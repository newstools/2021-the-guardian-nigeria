The Islamic Development Bank (www.ISDB.org) and Microsoft Philanthropies are joining hands to host a ‘5-day Live Webinar Training for the Youth’ on 20-24 June 2021.  The webinar entitled ‘Skilling Youth for Success Post COVID-19’ aims to support all youth through technology skills development for in-demand roles in the digital post-COVID-19 economy. COVID-19 has created a global economic crisis, forcing tens of millions of people around the world out of work, of whom, the youth have experienced some of the worst of the pandemic’s socio-economic impacts. Furthermore, due to school closures, lockdowns, and work from home, the pace of digital transformation has accelerated, thereby, creating a need for the youth to learn new technical and soft skills to rejoin the workforce. The series of Webinars by the IsDB and Microsoft will allow thousands of youth from across the globe to attend this online training which aims to support the youth through capacity building and enable them to thrive in a complex future equipping them with relevant major technical skillsets, such as digital and computing skills, as well as soft skills. These include empathy, personal resilience, perseverance, the ability to communicate effectively, cultural intelligence, and decision-making. The webinar series will cover the following topics:   The Islamic Development Bank and its partner, Microsoft Philanthropies, are looking forward to an engaging event with the youth from across the globe.
