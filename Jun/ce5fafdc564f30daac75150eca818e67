 Mala-Buni  “Can he give our party the desired democracy we are yearning for? This very serious question was what agitated my mind to say we are not heading in the right direction because of an established legal maxim.”  According to him, “there is no point deceiving ourselves; this is something that the new party leadership should be doing when we elect them at our convention.” Expressing concern over the situation, a member of the dissolved NWC, who also preferred not to be named, noted that the caretaker committee is an illegality and its tenure extension an aberration. He said for Buni, who is a serving governor of Yobe State and Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State to be in the caretaker committee is against the party’s constitution. “We also have people like Stella Okotete, Ismail Ahmed and others currently holding executive appointments in the committee. This portrayed us as a group of lawless people. People who have access to the president are doing things arbitrarily in APC. The dissolution of the NWC was wrong in the first instance.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
