The Nigeria Olympians Association’s (NOA) inaugural forum, banquet and awards ceremony will begin today with various activities at the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. According to NOA, the two-day event, which has former international tennis star, Prof. Sadiq Abdullahi, as the co-chairman, will feature a walk to the National Assembly complex, where the sportsmen will enlighten members of the House of Representatives and Senators on their programme aimed at developing Nigerian sports. The NOA will also visit some stakeholders in the city, hold media interviews and meet with chieftains of sports federations before holding its annual general meeting in the evening. The NOA forum and banquet ceremony will hold tomorrow at the NAF Conference Centre and Suites, Abuja. In a letter made available to The Guardian, the NOA explained that it works “to bring together past and current Olympians, who have represented the country with dignity and honour” and also help former Olympians to transition to life beyond competitive sports after retirement. It added: “There are over 1500 Olympians committed to promoting and advancing the sports reform agenda of the current administration- sports infrastructure, grassroots development, athletes welfare and sports as business. These areas will be explored at the NOA Forum and Awards ceremony breakout session.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
