Analysts at Codros capital said: “In the week ahead, we expect investors to continue cherry-picking stocks ahead of the H1-2021 dividend declarations. “With the recent development in the FI market, we are approaching an inflection point; we see scope for increased buying interest from risk-averse investors. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Investdata Consulting Limited said the banking sector and others remain attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the first quarter mixed numbers. “Again, the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks with growth prospects in 2021, looking at the way of mispriced equities ahead of the interim dividend announcement. “This is especially given that despite the seeming improvements, fixed income yield continues to offer a negative real rate of return due to the galloping inflation.” A total of 1,026 units of exchange-traded products valued at N160,140.75 were traded this week in eight deals compared with a total of 706 units valued at N5.127 million transacted in six deals during the preceding week.
