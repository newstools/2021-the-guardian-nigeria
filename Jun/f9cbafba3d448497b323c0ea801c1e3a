No fewer than 12 persons were injured as angry youths set three houses ablaze over a chieftaincy tussle in Ogwashi-Uku community in Delta State. It was gathered that the youths also stripped naked the wife of the Odogwu (War lord) of Ogwashi-Uku kingdom and raped her. The incident caused panic in the entire Azungwu quarters of the  community. Also,  livestock and two vehicles worth millions of naira owned by one Chief Odogwu were destroyed. Narrating his ordeal, the Odogwu of Ogwash-Uku, Chief Gabriel Ohai, lamented the lawlessness and impunity in the community. He said as this was unfolding, policemen were drafted into the matter but the suspects did not submit. Instead, they called their cohorts as early as 6:00a.m. to carry out the devilish acts and resist police arrest. He continued: “Immediately the police left, the hoodlums moved in their numbers into my house, pulled down my gate, fence and move to my palace, set my house ablaze, stripped my wife naked, rape her, burnt down my two vehicles and moved to my farm, about 20 kilometres away from where I live, and set the building there ablaze.” An Azungwu community youth who confirmed the story on condition of anonymity, said the destruction was too much for Chief Odogwu.
According to him, his personal houses and farm were set ablaze by youths loyal to a rival chief. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident when contacted. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
