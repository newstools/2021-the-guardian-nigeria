Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, told journalists yesterday that the prime suspect, Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu, who was paraded yesterday at the police headquarters in Ikeja, was tracked and arrested in her Yaba residence after she fled from the apartment on June 15. The 300-level student of the university conspired with others, now at large, and allegedly murdered Ataga by stabbing him severally with a kitchen knife at a short service apartment in Lagos. Odumosu said during the search, the suspect, a Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos, was caught with a blood-soaked cloth worn on the day of the incident and confessed to stabbing the deceased with a kitchen knife after a struggle. She further confessed to taking the knife away while leaving the scene and disposed of it in a dustbin at her residence and also stole the deceased iPhone. Some of the items found with her include one fake driver’s licence bearing Mary Johnson, complimentary cards, Access Bank statement account, one Nigerian passport, the suspect’s photograph, one National Identification Card, one UBA ATM debit card and University of Lagos identity card. The police boss revealed that investigation was ongoing to arrest other accomplices, while the case would be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded. Meanwhile, Ojukwu told newsmen yesterday that she stabbed Super TV CEO Michael Ataga to death in self defence according to a report by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). “On a Sunday, June 13, he asked that I get a place where we can stay. I checked online and sent to him, he asked me to go check it out which I did and paid. “On Monday, June 14, we were together drinking, smoking and I also went to get food. On Tuesday, June 15, he was making advances at me and I resisted, so he became violent and later had his way. “In the afternoon, he ordered for smoke, ate and we became high because I also smoked with him even though I was still angry about the first one he did. “So, I was on my own, watching a movie on the couch. He came at me again and I said no because I wasn’t happy with him. “I told him that he doesn’t help me but only plays me around, he kept trying to make advances and I was resisting so I had to defend myself. “At some point, he hit my head on the wall and was choking me. I tried escaping but the door was locked so he pulled me back. “I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed him twice in the neck and threw the knife on the bed. “He then tried reaching for the knife so I picked it again and stabbed him the third time,” she said.
