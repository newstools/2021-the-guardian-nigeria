Anti-Corruption organisation, Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) has sued the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and two others for alleged removal of Nigeria Copyright Commission (NCC) Chairman, Dr. Tonye Clinton Jaja. Joined as co-defendants in the suit are NCC and the Federal Ministry of Culture and Information. HEDA in the suit filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja, is seeking for the declaration that the purported removal of Jaja  by Malami on behalf  of the President is illegal and ran foul  to section 50 of the Copyright Act. They also want an order from the court to restrain Malami from meddling with the statutory functions of the third defendant (Federal Ministry of Information and Culture) and the second defendant (Nigeria Copyright Commission) as contained in 50 of the Copyright Act. In a 13 paragraph of affidavit, sworn by Saidu Muhammed Lawal, the organisation said “the third defendant (Ministry of Information and Culture) has the power to act on behalf of the president to remove the chairman of the second defendant (Nigeria Copyright Commission). “The first defendant (Malami) is yet to reverse himself on the action taken pursuant to Exhibit HEDA 1 in foul of section 50 of the copyright Act. It is in the interest of justice to nullify or set aside the purported action of the first defendant (Malami) as contained in his letter dated 15 October 2020, Exhibit HEDA 1, as unlawful and unconstitutional and contrary to section 50 of the copyright Act.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
