The families received N1m each to assuage their pains as they continue to mourn their late breadwinners. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Beechcraft KingAir B350i aircraft crashed while returning to the Abuja Airport after reporting engine failure. Seven officers on board the military aircraft died near Nigeria’s capital Abuja. Presenting the cheques, the Chairperson of the taskforce, Mrs. Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji said the gesture was to provide succour to the family members. She extolled the contributions of the fallen heroes in enhancing national security. “We know that your families are going through difficult times, but we want you to know that you are not forgotten because they remain very much dear in our hearts.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
