Any information, however small, could help us locate the crucifix and identify those responsible.” The reverend canon, Andrew Shipton, of All Saints Church, said the theft had caused “considerable sadness” among his congregation and the wider community. He said: “The crucifix was situated in a consecrated area where many ashes are buried. “It was a great shock to find that the bronze statue of our Lord had gone and a cause of considerable sadness.” He added that the crucifix was sculpted by the internationally acclaimed Frank Roper who undertook work for churches and cathedrals across the country before his death in 2005.
