Lagos, Ogun council polls as test run Two years away from the 2023 general elections, Nigerian women have realised the need to plan ahead. They have resolved to speak out if they must attain higher percentage of political participation.
 
When Nigeria returned to democratic governance in 1999, there was slight increase in women political participation both in elective and appointive offices, but in spite of that, the national average of participation is still far below the 30 per cent affirmative declaration or the suggested 35 per cent by the National Gender Policy (NGP) in the last 21 years of democratic governance. For instance, from 1999 to 2021, the country is yet to elect a female governor in any of the 36 states or produce a female vice president not to talk of any of the major political parties electing a woman as their national chairman.
  
To get women prepared ahead of the next general elections, some women gathered under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos on Thursday May 6 2021 to agitate for increased participation and inclusion in elective positions across the country. The programme tagged: ‘Inclusion of APC Women in Elective Positions: Lagos State as a Pacesetter’ was convened by Jumoke Okoya-Thomas, a former member of the House of Representatives who represented Lagos Island I Federal Constituency. She is also the incumbent Women Leader in Lagos APC.  National women representative of APC, Okotete said: “Every woman sees others as competitors. But when we shine the light the men will have no option than to join force with us. When I came in, I didn’t meet any structure in place but I told myself that I needed to build a foundation that will take us to lead, come 2023. The only way this country can get out of this challenge is to give women a position of leadership. There was poor communication. Every woman occupying a position of authority in APC must ensure that they give opportunities to women in the party.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
