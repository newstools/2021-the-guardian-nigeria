Managing Director, Rite Foods, Saleem Adegunwa, has hinted that the factory generates its electricity through the largest solar plant in West Africa to facilitate uninterrupted power supply. Adegunwa said this is necessary to maintain its technology and state-of-the-art infrastructure it deployed into its production factory while enhancing the quality of the environment through carbon footprint reduction. He added that technological advancement could be attributed to the success of the company in the Nigerian market, adding that the company’s exceptional brands are produced with one top production plant, thus ensuring the most hygienic and global standard. He said: “The factory generates its source of electricity via the largest solar plant in West Africa, alongside its usage of gas and diesel induced plants connected to the National Grid that facilitates seamless, uninterrupted power supply to the highly sensitive, sophisticated technology infrastructure.” According to him, the global approach was induced to enable the company to deliver unparalleled brands to meet consumers’ expectations, which according to market survey, has been surpassed, with the largest market share in the sausage and beverage sector of the Nigerian economy. “The company has also made an inroad into the entertainment industry with the sponsorship of the Prophetess movie premiere which recently debuted in Oyo and Lagos States, as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative.” “Nigerian Idol, a platform for budding and talented singers to express themselves has also been sponsored by this emerging, friendly conglomerate, which also organised a prototype of the show for content drivers in Lagos recently, christened ‘Bigi Media Idol’. “In its environmental preservation programme, the organisation recently embarked on a clean-up of the Alpha beach in Lagos, and immensely supported the less privileged in one of the communities in the state with consumable household items, as part of its CSR programme,” he said.
