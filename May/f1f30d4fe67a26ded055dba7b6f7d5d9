A middle-aged man has been arrested for an alleged gang-raping of a 25-year-old lady (names withheld) in Yola, Adamawa State, while three other suspects are at large. The suspected rapists were said to have given N500 for their victim to procure drugs for treatment after the rape. The woman was lured by her boyfriend into a hotel room, where three other men were already positioned for the crime. Police source, who confirmed the incident, said the principal suspect, her boyfriend, had been apprehended. He is now in custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Yola, while the police are working to apprehend other suspects. It was learnt that the suspect, Abubakar Usman, paid N5,000 for one night. The 22-year-old Usman, a commercial tricycle operator, who resides in Jambutu, narrated how he met the lady who lives at Upper Luggere, in Jimeta and how he collected her phone contact. He said they took her to Ebis Royal Resort and paid N5,000 for a room. “When we entered the room, my friends later joined us and immediately she saw my friends, she became suspicious. I assured her that nothing would happen to her. “She tried to run out of the room, but one of my friends held and fell her on the ground. I had sex with her first before my friends took their turns. “After that, I followed her out to the junction and gave her N500 and her mobile phone. “It was at the junction that she held my shirt and started shouting, which attracted people who arrested and took me to Doubeli Police Station,” Usman said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Yahaya Nguroje, who confirmed the arrest, said the operatives of the command were doing everything to arrest the fleeing suspects. Nguroje added that the suspect would be charged to court after investigation. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
