As part of its efforts to develop judo in the state, the Lagos State Judo Association (LSJA) plans to take the sport to schools.
 
LSJA Chairman, Sheriff Hammed, yesterday said the association hopes to attract more young people to take to the sport, adding, “This is actually a journey because the new board wants to ensure we take judo to schools across the five divisions of Lagos State and educate the students on rudiment of the game. “For us, grassroots remain the bedrock of sports development and with the support, we have been enjoying from Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu through the Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), our focus is to grow the sport as there are more talents that abound in Lagos.”
 
He added that LSJA would organise competitions for schools in the state to identify talents from the tournaments, saying, “the benefits of judo goes beyond fighting and self-defence. Judo teaches at its core values like courage, respect, modesty, friendship, honour, honesty, self-control and honesty. We believe these values would go a long way to help our youths become true leaders of tomorrow.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
