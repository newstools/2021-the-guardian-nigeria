This is contained in a statement signed and released by  Assistant Superintendent of Corps 1, (ASC1)  Oluwaseun Abolurin, the command’s spokesperson in Lagos State on Saturday. The statement stated that the NSCDC personnel on patrol at  Iyana – Odo area in the  Alimosho Local Government Area (LGA)  of Lagos State busted the syndicates on May 22 at 0335 a.m. The statement said that  the suspected vandals planned to load a-30,000-litre -capacity truck with  PMS but for the  gallant efforts of the NSCDC personnel. “However, the suspected syndicates met their waterloo as the NSCDC operatives on patrol were hinted by the Command’s robust ‘Community Based Intelligence Network’ that  busted them at the scene of the crime,” the statement said. According to the statement, the actual content in the truck was yet to be ascertained. “The suspected vandals also took to their heels having sighted the team from our Anti- Vandal Unit on patrol at the Iyana – Odo axis and others from the state command. “No suspects were apprehended as all of them dived into the slum. “The NSCDC operatives remained stationed from dusk to dawn without any fear of attack until the operation was apparently successful,” the statement said. The statement added that the  NSCDC Commandant in Lagos State, Mr Paul Ayeni ,also led a team of officers to the  scene  on  an  on-the-spot assessment of activities of the vandals. The statement stated that the impounded truck from the scene of the operation  had  been towed  to the State Command’s  headquarters on the order of the Commandant. It added that the  Commandant had also ordered  that investigation  should commence into the matter in order to get to its root and ensure that  justice is served. The statement  said that the commandant had informed the management of the  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)  in Lagos  of the development. The commandant was quoted  in the statement as saying   that the vandals who escaped  would be apprehended and would be  brought to book in accordance with the provisions of the law. “ I also appeal to the  citizens and residents of the state to continue to avail the corps with relevant security information which will assist its personnel in ensuring maximum security and safety of lives and property .” He said that such would also help corps  to strategise  on how to successful protect  oil pipelines,  critical national assets and infrastructure  in Lagos State.
