The Osun State Police Command, yesterday, arrested a teenager and one other for allegedly dispossessing travellers of their belongings. The suspects, Abiodun Abdulahi, aged 35, a resident of Ado-Ekiti, and 19-year-old Godwin John, who hails from Imo State, were said to have robbed passengers of a bus from Lagos around 9:45 am yesterday. The incident took place at Ife/Osun road in Osun State, according to the Commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, who disclosed that policemen arrested the suspects at noon after escaping the scene. Luck was said to have ran out on them when a victim later visited a bank in Ile-Ife to block his account from being accessed using his ATM card that was stolen, only to see the suspects at the banking hall attempting to withdraw cash with the ATM. He immediately alerted the Police, who arrested the duo. Opalola said the suspects confessed to the crime and efforts were on to apprehend other fleeing gang members on the run.
