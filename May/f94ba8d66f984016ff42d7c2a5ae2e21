NAN also reports that members of the Odua Peoples Congress had a bloody clash with members of a secret cult, resulting in loss of lives and property. Mr Salami Bolaji, state Commissioner of Police, told newsmen on Friday in Akure that all the suspects would  be charged to court once the Judiciary Staff
