According to Manager Director, EMEA Emerging Markets, Alex Okosi, for more than a decade, YouTube has helped artistes developed and export the African sound to music lovers, fans and listeners worldwide while also enabling collaborations across the continent and around the world. “As a result, it’s only natural that the platform, where cultural movements grow and build, plays a central role in the celebration of this important month for the continent as a whole. The past 10 years have shown, without a doubt, that Africa loves YouTube and YouTube has found a true home in Africa,”. “Starting today, South African superstar Sho Majozi, Kenyan boy-band Sauti Sol and Nigerian Afrobeats star Fireboy DML will all deliver live performances of their most popular hits, which fans can enjoy via livestream on each of the artistes’ YouTube channels. “In addition to performances, YouTube Music has partnered with Afro Nation, Slikour Onlife and Leading Ladies Africa to host a series of industry panel sessions focused on African Music. The virtual sessions will focus on topics; The Global Impact of Afrobeats, The Acceleration of Amapiano and Women x Music. Okosi added: “We are excited to work with Idris Elba and MTV Base to celebrate Africa Day this year through another powerful concert event. With African music continuing to connect and inspire people around the world, the timing is perfect to shine the spotlight on the next wave of African artists that will make a global impact on music and culture.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
