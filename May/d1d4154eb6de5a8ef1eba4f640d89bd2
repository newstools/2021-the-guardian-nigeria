Photo/TWITTER/SENBENAYADE  The Guardian recalled that since January this year, 29 magistrates had been protesting against non-payment of two-year salaries since their supposed employment by the state government. State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Tanko Ashang, disclosed this yesterday in Calabar, saying the magistrates whose employment did not follow due process were not captured in the payroll. He explained that the government constituted a committee headed by the Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu on January 26, 2021, to review the issue. The committee recommended 29 magistrates for employment to the governor after a rigorous exercise, adding that Governor Ayade had approved the list of the 29 magistrates. “With this approval, appointment letters will be issued to the new magistrates and they will from henceforth, be captured in the payroll of judicial officers,” he added.
