The House of Representatives has enjoined the authorities to ensure the speedy resolution of the strike action embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN). Besides, the lower legislative chamber also called on the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to suspend the proposed increase in electricity tariff. Adopting a motion initiated by Sergius Ose Ogun, the House urged both the federal and state governments to wade into the issue in the interest of Nigerians. The Green Chamber mandated the Committees on Labour, Employment and Productivity and Judiciary to interface with the Minister of Labour and Employment and the Attorneyâ€“General of the Federation and Minister of Justice on steps taken to address the matter and report back within four weeks for further legislative action. Ogun, while moving the motion at the plenary presided over by Deputy Speaker Ahmed Wase, regretted the lingering strike.
