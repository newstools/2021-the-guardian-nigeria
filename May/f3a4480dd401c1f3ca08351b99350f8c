The All Progressives Congress (APC) is silent on timetable for its congresses and national convention.  The National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, however, faulted media reports that the ruling party would kick-start the exercise this week. He described the speculators as “political jobbers bent on undermining the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee.” The scribe continued: “We have never lied on our party’s activities and we simply have no reason to. The consultative party leadership style instituted by Governor Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the CECPC has institutionalised the APC as a party of processes and internal democracy.” “The CECPC is focused and is delivering its mandate to recover, rebuild and reposition the APC as well as achieve peace-building, true reconciliation and to give a sense of belonging to every member of the party. “On Monday, May 17,2021, the APC National Secretariat resumed from the Sallah break and will also resume work on several ongoing and important party activities. As usual, we will promptly communicate outcomes of these activities through official channels when available.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
