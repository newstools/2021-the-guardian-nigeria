Our thoughts are with all those affected.” The Lancashire fire department said on Twitter that a major incident had been declared over a suspected gas explosion and firefighters were in the process of searching the collapsed properties. Local resident Dan Knowles said the sound of the explosion could be heard from his house four streets away. “My wife and I thought there was an earthquake which woke us, the whole house shook,” he said. “We immediately checked on our kids and got back in bed. We then heard sirens,” he added, adding that his family had shut their gas off when they learnt the likely cause of the explosion. The area’s member of parliament David Morris said his “thoughts and prayers” were with local residents. “Thank you to all of the emergency services who are currently on the scene,” he added.
