The Managing Director of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, has cautioned staff of the agency to ignore speculation of a possible merger as contained in a purported report of a technical working group constituted by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. “Concerning the said report of the committee from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, such a report has not been officially communicated to NEPZA, and at the right moment, the position of NEPZA will be conveyed by its board to the appropriate authorities,’’ he said. The staff agitated about a speculated attempt to undermine the legal status of the authority. Recall that NEPZA is a creation of Act 63 of 1992 with the sole regulatory power to license, manage and supervise the country’s free trade zones. Adesugba who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the authority made the remarks on Wednesday at a weekly parley with the staff of the authority in Abuja.
