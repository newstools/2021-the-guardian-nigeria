Both teams meet in today’s fixture at the Soccer Temple Stadium in Agege, Lagos. MFM FC, currently 13th on the log, after garnering 27 points from 21 matches with seven victories, six draws and eight losses, will hope to beat Lobi Stars, who are eight on the table from 20 games, having won nine games, drawn four and suffered seven defeats. The Olukoya Boys, still basking in the euphoria of their 2-0 win over Warri Wolves FC on the road in last week’s fixture, will hope to maintain their new found form when they host the Ortom boys. Speaking on the fixture to The Guardian yesterday, Coach Gabriel said he was optimistic of victory, adding that everything has been put in place to ensure victory against the Makurdi-based team so as to leave the relegation zone and end the season among the top four teams. “Winning tomorrow’s game (today) against Lobi Stars is non negotiable. Our players are aware what a victory against our opponent will do to us. This will definitely take us out of the relegation zone and make us comfortable on the table. The boys are set for tomorrow’s encounter and I am certain we are going to win. “The team is gradually coming up to its normal pattern of play, which everyone knows MFM with. Right from the coaching crew, up to the players, we are all working together assiduously to achieve success in tomorrow’s match and subsequently in the rest of our games for the season. “I believe the league is still open to every team and with a turnaround on our side, it is possible we finish the season among the best four clubs by God’s grace. “A victory against Lobi Stars will move us up to 30 points, at least, we will be able to close up the gap between us and the top teams. If you look at the points between them and us, I don’t think there is much difference. Somehow, I still believe that teams are going to lose their position because in the NPFL, any team can lose and win anywhere,” he stated.
