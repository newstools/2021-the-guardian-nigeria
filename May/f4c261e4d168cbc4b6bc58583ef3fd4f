For Nigeria to achieve its full potential, economic expert in Islamic finance has called for the nation to embrace its principles, as well as explore and exploit its many advantages for individual and national benefits.
   
Islamic finance represents a unique method of financial transaction without an element of interest either paid or charged; hence its popular designation as being “non-interest” finance. 
   
Rather than being a mere conduit for funds transfer between depositors and borrowers of funds, the model seeks to create partnership between the two units with an arrangement for the two to share in the profit and loss of the real economic activity.  The goals include among others: No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, peace, justice and strong institutions.
    
To ensure that the 17 goals and 169 targets of the SDGs are met by 2030 as planned, it is estimated that about $2.5 trillion are needed every year (UNCTAD World Investment Report, 2014), Alaro said the worldwide zakat contributions alone was estimated at $1 trillion in 2018, which this implies that zakat alone, representing just one component of Islamic Social Finance, can provide more than one third of the needed funds for the realization of SDGs in developing countries. 
  
In Nigeria, he said since the introduction of Islamic finance about two decades ago, it has made tremendous contributions to the development of the Nigerian economy in areas such as financial inclusion and infrastructure development. 
   
Others are job creation, economic empowerment of the citizenry and Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) development among others.  
   
On financial inclusion, he said: “In 2018, the banked population stood at 39.5 million, up from 36.9 million recorded in 2016, while 60 per cent of the Nigerian adult population have since become financially included. 
   
“As at 2012, only 28.6 million adults were banked, representing 32.5 per cent of the adult population. The situation was worse in 2010, as the survey then revealed that 25.4 million Nigerians, representing only 30 per cent of the adult population, were banked, with 46.3 per cent or 39.2 million of the adult population financially excluded. 
  
“That itself, however, was another improvement on the figure recorded in 2008, when only 1 in 5 Nigerian adults had a bank account, and over half of the adult population (52.5 per cent) were financially excluded,” Alaro stated.
   
On infrastructure development, he said Sukuk is one important and viable alternative that can positively change the narrative of African infrastructural inefficiency. Sukuk is an instrument of Islamic Capital Market.  “In May 2020, the third FGN Sukuk worth ₦150 billion was also offered for subscription. The offer attracted a high-level subscription of ₦669,124 billion, representing an over subscription rate of 446 per cent,” he stated.
   
In view of the developments, Alaro recommended that Nigeria with its large Muslim population should aim at anything less than making the country the hub of Islamic finance in Africa, noting that Nigeria is still trailing in the global Sukuk market behind South Africa, a country with less than 5 per cent Muslim population.
  
With the unprecedented success rate of sukuk for road and school construction in the country, he said governments at all levels, as well as corporate organisations should take advantage of the innovative instrument to develop other key sectors of the economy. 
  
On the regulation, he said the practice of Islamic finance in Nigeria needs a complete set of facilitating laws that will replace most of the subsidiary legislations and guidelines that are currently the backbone of Islamic finance practice in the country.
  
According to him, necessary amendments should be made into the laws with a view to giving judges on the Shariah Court bench jurisdiction to hear and decide cases relating to Islamic finance.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
