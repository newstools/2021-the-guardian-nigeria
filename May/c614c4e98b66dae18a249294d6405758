 Ogoni Clean Up  The President, Fegalo Nsuke stated this while addressing members yesterday, saying the agency has been riddled with corruption and members of the management team can attest to sharp practices going on currently there. He expressed worry that the systemic embezzlement of funds in HYPREP has become widely known and sooner or later, it may engulf the water project fund. He called on the agency to stick to the decision to implement an integrated water project for Ogoni. He added that any deviation from the implementation of an integrated water project for them would amount to shortchanging their interests. On the need to clean up the region, Nsuke said what was going on and had been going on in the name of cleanup was an expression of approval to official corruption. “HYPREP has not cleaned Ogoni. What they have done is to loot and eat fat on our struggles, blood and pains and it is unfortunate that this robbery has been official and remains unchecked despite several cries,” he added.
