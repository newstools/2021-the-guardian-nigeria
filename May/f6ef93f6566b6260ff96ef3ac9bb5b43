Bauchi State Road and Traffic Agency (BAROTA) has commenced implementation of law banning commercial motorcycle operation, passed one year ago by the state governor. BAROTA chairman, Air Commodore Tijjani Baba Gamawa, while briefing newsmen on Tuesday, said that the law would take full effect on defaulters. According to him, over 290 ‘illegal’ traders had been relocated and over 100 road traffic offenders had been arrested. He added that through payment of fines, the agency had raked in over N4 million in three months into the government treasury. Tijani warned drivers and riders to adhere to the traffic laws of the state, saying that defaulters stand to pay a fine ranging from N5,000 to N20,000. He said: “Commercial motorcycles remain banned in Bauchi State. There is no commercial motorcycling in Bauchi State. I want to bring to the notice of good people of Bauchi State that the law is still there and we are going to implement it immediately.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
