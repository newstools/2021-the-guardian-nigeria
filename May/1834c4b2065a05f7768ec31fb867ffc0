The negative impact of the new wave of insurgency targeted at educational institutions has become a source of concern to the Civil Society Action Coalition on Education For All (CSACEFA), Abuja chapter. While marking the 2021 Global Action Week for Education (GAWE) yesterday, in Abuja, the focal person of the coalition for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abdullahi Sale, enumerated some of the consequences of the attacks. Beside reduced enrolment and permanent drop-out, he also indicated that the insurgency could lead to the withdrawal of educational personnel. According to Sale, the uncertainty caused by the development has the potential to impact negatively on government resources thereby reducing the capacity of government to manage or deliver quality education. He, therefore, urged the government to reinforce counter-insurgency operations in their states to protect schools. As a motivation to return children to school, the coalition canvassed award of scholarships and other incentives. To aid online learning, it urged governments to equip the schools with modern facilities, as well as train teachers and students on handling online educational devices. “The effect of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the state of insecurity in the country have interrupted the education and future of billions of students and children across the nation and globally.” In line with the ‘One Billion Voices Campaign’ of the Global Campaign for Education for this year, Sale said CSACEFA FCT has highlighted series of actions and activities to increase public financing of education and to promote life-long learning opportunities for all, especially in the FCT.
