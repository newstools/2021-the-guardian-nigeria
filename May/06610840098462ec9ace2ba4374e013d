Instead, the Christian body is advocating the enactment of a brand new legal document for Nigeria that will be in sync with the reality on ground and capable of enhancing the nation’s growth on all fronts. In a statement titled: “Nigeria’s Constitutional Review: PFN’s Stand” and jointly signed by its National President, Bishop Francis Wale Oke, National Secretary, Dr. Cosmas Ilechukwu and National Legal Adviser, Funmi Quadri (SAN), the body bemoaned that the existing 1999 Constitution is fraught with irregularities that are not helpful to the country’s growth. The statement reads in part: “The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) is aware of the on-going constitutional review process, being undertaken by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the public hearing sessions scheduled by the Senate for May 26 and 27, 2021 across the six geo-political zones of the country.” Consequently, the Fellowship maintained that the current Constitution, which serves as the conveyor belt for the administration of the country, is anti-people and faulty. The body further maintained: “We declare that the present Constitution is not a people’s Constitution and does not, in anyway, reflect the aspirations and yearnings of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and the people of Nigeria. “The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) is firmly of the view that the review process by amending a segment of the Constitution might just be an exercise in futility that cannot meet the people’s expectation.” The Fellowship, therefore, asserted that it was joining forces with other groups in the country to repudiate the 1999 Constitution, calling instead, for the enactment of a new one that would be acceptable and more pliable to the yearnings of Nigerians. It added: “We stand with the different groups and people across the length and breadth of Nigeria in rejecting the 1999 Constitution, and maintain that it cannot deliver a framework for good governance. We do not see the on-going process of ‘proposed alteration to the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999’ achieving the objectives of restructuring Nigeria, as desired and canvassed by millions of Nigerians and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN).” While demanding for a new constitution the body said: “The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) demands for a new Constitution coming as per other matters coming under paragraph 17 of the public notice that will guarantee a truly Federalist structure for the good and prosperity of all Nigerians.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
