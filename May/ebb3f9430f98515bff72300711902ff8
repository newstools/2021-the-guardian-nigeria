Anchorman of the summit, Sam Hart, who is also Director-General of the Abia State Marketing and Quality Assurance Management Agency, said history was replete with a long list of successful businesses now being remembered in the past tense, as they no longer existed. “The Abia State Government in conjunction with ACCIMA, has, therefore, decided to host this summit to look into the issues relating to this malaise and begin to synthesize solutions that will ensure the longevity of current successful businesses in the state,” he said. Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, who will be Special Guest of Honour at the summit, will declare the convention open, while former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, will deliver the keynote address. Other discussants from the public and private sectors of the economy across the country and beyond are also expected to address the summit and panel sessions. President of ACCIMA, Chief Lawrence Obetta, told The Guardian that the summit would afford members of the public an opportunity to ask questions and get answers on what impeded businesses and how to address them. He said the summit would also address poor electricity supply and high tariffs for business services that entrepreneurs generally complain about, among sundry other issues that affect the success or failure of businesses in Abia State and the entire country.
