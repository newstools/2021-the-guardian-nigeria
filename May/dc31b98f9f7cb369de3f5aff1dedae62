Lagos State Government has been urged to construct good drainage across communities and create awareness on the need for residents to have  clean environment. The Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative (YEDI) made this call during a sensitisation tour of Orile, Bode Thomas and Mile 2 in commemoration of the World Malaria Day outreach. The programme, which had the support of ACT Foundation, Exxon Mobil and Grass Root Soccer, targeted 10,000 persons in the community for sensitisation on the need for proper hygiene, while 100 people got instant medical care. Members from the Department of Community Health and Primary Health Care, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, were present at the event for collaboration. The Acting Executive Director, YEDI, Tomisin Adeoye, urged residents to ensure  clean environment, adding that it was essential that malaria be prevented by the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets. She said this was important for the vulnerable groups like pregnant women and children under five years. “As you can see, this neighbourhood is very dirty and that is part of the reason we came here. So, they can be advised on the importance of keeping a good environment to ensure good hygiene. A dirty community is prone to malaria. Besides, we offer health services to these people, including malaria testing and distribution of bed nets. We have medical doctors and also work in partnership with the community outreach from LASUTH. “We still have a long way to go. The government needs to continue to sensitise the people, especially people in disadvantaged communities.” They should sensitise them through the media and grass-root engagement on the need to have a clean environment.”Dr Femi Adebayo from LASUTH said testing for malaria was essential as it helps to reduce unnecessary use of anti-malarial drugs and herbal medications, thereby preventing drug abuse. She implored Lagosians to remain committed to collective efforts towards effective malaria control in the state. “Our individual and collective roles at ensuring a clean environment as well as the use of preventive anti-malarial measures as well as appropriate diagnosis prior to treatment cannot be overemphasized,” he said.
