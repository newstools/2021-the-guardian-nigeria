The National Coordinator/Managing Director, Nigeria Farmers Group and Cooperative Society (NFGCS), Tedheke Retson, has indicated that solutions to insecurity include empowering the local government administrations and boosting agriculture. Speaking with The Guardian in an interview in Abuja recenty, he said most of Nigerian problems stemmed from dysfunctionality of the local government administration and failed agricultural systems. According to him, the use of force alone could not help the country to overcome insecurity. “The local government system must work again. If the local government does not work, development cannot be inclusive; it cannot be total; it cannot be foundational and it cannot be progressive,” he said. According to him, when the local government is strengthened, it will be able to build the rural communities. “If the states dedicate just five per cent of their resources to agro development every month or every quarter, I assure you no Jupiter can keep insurgency active in this country. “The foundation of insurgency is the neglect of rural Nigeria. You have to understand this statement in contexts. Because states have refused to develop their rural communities, bandits, kidnappers and extremists have found willing cooperators in the rural Nigeria whom they can recruit,” he said.
