Photo/TWITTER/AERIALLAGOS  Emmanuel, in a statement, said the distribution of life jackets of different sizes as part of the government’s effort aimed at ensuring adequate safety for all waterways users, especially during the rainy season. He said the agency distributed 400 life jackets of various sizes to ferry passengers, school children and boat operators in Lagos. “The exercise took place at some terminals such as Ebute-Ero, Sabokoji, Liverpool, Temidire, Coconut jetties in CMS and Apapa areas of Lagos State. “Since Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s assumption of office as Lagos State Governor, there have been reduced cases of boat mishaps on waterways. “This success story is due to the massive investment of the current administration in the waterways sub-sector, especially in safety improvement and awareness,” Emmanuel said. The LASWA general manager warned boat operators to always drive with caution and ensure all passengers put on their life jackets before boarding. He also advised boat operators to check weather conditions before sailing during the rainy season. Emmanuel reiterated the state government’s commitment to ensuring safe, prosperous, and viable waterways in the state. He said the safety of lives was a priority to the Lagos State Waterways Authority as he assured ferry passengers of their safety at all times.
