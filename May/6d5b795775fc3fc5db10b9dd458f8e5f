President of Church of Christ In Nation (COCIN), Dr. Dachollom Datiri, has said that government seems to be overwhelmed and unconcerned about the rate of insecurity. Rev. Datiri described the development as disturbing and an embarrassment to the country. He spoke yesterday at the 99th General Church Council (GCC) at COCIN headquarters in Jos, Plateau State. What is happening now, according to him, only portrays either a government that is colluding with the terrorists or one that is confused or failed. “Your guess is as good as mine. Government must rise up to her responsibility and quickly so, or Nigeria will soon be overrun by this terrorist group,” he said. The COCIN president also condemned the alarming rate of kidnapping and armed robbery in the country. He said: “The whole nation is already engulfed in this miserable situation and the lives of countless innocent families in Nigeria have been impoverished and plunged into extreme traumatic conditions. “Unfortunately, the government seems unconcerned. For us, by Wednesday, May 19, Rev. Polycarp Zongo will be seven months in the hands of his captors. Our hearts have continued to bleed all this while but to no avail.” Attacks on communities, he said, are already engulfing the whole nation, as most states are affected. “What has happened to the professional Nigerian Army that is praised for its clinical and successful roles in keeping peace in other countries? What has happened to our police force? Is our security overwhelmed? Or has our security been commandeered to pursue the agenda of the terrorists? These are questions the Nigerian government must answer,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
