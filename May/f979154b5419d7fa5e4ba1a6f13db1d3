Vice Captain, Ikoyi Club 1938 Golf Section, Dr. Anthony Oboh Vice captain of the prestigious Ikoyi Club 1938 Golf Section, Dr. Anthony Oboh, says maintenance and improvement of facilities at the club is the priority of its new executive, led by Dr. Innocent Okoro. Oboh adds that it will be a disservice to the golf course, which he believes, is the most expensive in the nation, if the facilities are not in top shape. The civil engineer, who has been playing golf for the 18 years he has been a member of the club, adds: “We must first give kudos to the past captains and past executives of this section that have worked before us, because if they were not here, we wouldn’t have seen something to build on. But, I must tell you that maintenance and improvement of facilities here will be our priority. “Some of us believe that per square foot, Ikoyi Club is the most expensive club in Nigeria, because we have up to 70 to 80 hectares of land occupied by the golf course. So, per-square foot Ikoyi golf course is the most expensive golf course in Nigeria… so, we must have the best golf facilities.” Oboh explains that part of the challenge facing the club is to make the fairways, the course way better to play, adding, “we will live up to it by each day… we will keep improving until we get the best facilities for our members to enjoy.” According to the vice captain, there is always room for improvement and naturally the new executive will make their services better because they see the members as kings. Oboh, who described golf as necessary to maintain a good health, adds, “it’s a game for life. If you start, within a week or two you will want to quit, but I bet it, if you don’t quit within one month, you will never want to leave the game of golf again.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
