ASI declined by 367.97 absolute points, representing a dip of 0.92 per cent to close at 39,433.81 points while market capitalisation depreciated by N193 billion to close at N20.637 trillion. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks including Unilever Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Zenith Bank and Julius Berger. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We expect the market performance to remain bearish in the next trading session, as investors continue to take a position in the fixed income space due to rising yields.” Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage: “After another day of negative activity, the ASI has kicked off the month on a negative note, however, savvy investors continue to pick fundamentally sound names amid sporadic market activity. Therefore, we expect a more mixed session tomorrow, with the likelihood of further selloffs remaining high.” Investor sentiment declined as 16 stocks advanced while 22 declined.
