A board member of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Ahmed Isa Kaita, has declared his intention to become the next president of the body.
Kaita took the slot of Philanthropist/Ex-Officio member formerly occupied by Chief Solomon Ogba on the AFN board when the former AFN boss resigned last year. He told The Guardian yesterday that he was coming to complete the tenure of the north in the AFN. Kaita is from Katsina State, while the current president, Shehu Ibrahim Gusau, is from Zamfara in the same North-west zone. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Kaita said he had consulted with his people on the need to replace Gusau as president of the AFN. He is convinced that the outgoing president, Gusau, did not complete his tenure before crisis broke out two years ago. He added: “The north has to complete its term. The AFN needs somebody, who does not only understand the system, but has the interest of the athletes at heart and I perfectly understands the system. I have consulted with my people and I am coming to complete the tenure of the north. I will hand over to somebody from the south at the end of my tenure.” Kaita says his plan is to sponsor zonal competitions across the country, beginning with northern states like Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Kaduna and Kano. “I live among these youths and since sports have a way of taking talented youths off the streets, I decided to organise sports activities within and outside Katsina and today, most of the youths are happy to have made something meaningful through their talents. About 30 of them are on scholarships in various institutions in Nigeria,” he said. Former AFN Technical Director, Navy Commodore Omatseye Nesiama (rtd) had signified his intention to run for the AFN presidency. A source close to the chairman of Delta Sports Commission, Tony Okowa, hinted yesterday that he is also eyeing the AFN presidency, though Okowa has not come out openly to declare his intention. The Guardian recalls that World Athletics (WA) had ordered the AFN to hold its congress on or before June 14. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
