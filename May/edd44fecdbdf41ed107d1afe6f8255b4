While calling for a partnership between UBEC and NCPND to shore education of children with disabilities, Bobboyi said UBEC has also come up with a proposed intervention called “Model Smart School” that will address the modern ICT needs. He thanked the visiting Executive Secretary for the courtesy call and assured of the commission’s commitment on the new partnership which will make a difference in the life of children with disabilities or special needs.
