This follows the displacement of over 10,000 thousand people in the local council as a result of recent military operation in the area to recover their stolen weapons, after 12 soldiers were reportedly killed. Country Director of ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi, said, when he visited Governor Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday, at the Government House, Makurdi, that the organisation would assist the displaced with food and non-food items. Soliciting government’s support to execute the assignment in Konshisha, she expressed ActionAid’s readiness to rehabilitate boreholes in the area to address water needs of the displaced persons. Ortom acknowledged the concern of ActionAid to the plight of displaced persons in Benue. He lamented the steady increase in the number of IDPs in the state due to renewed attacks on Benue communities, noting that resources of the state had been overstretched with increased humanitarian crisis. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to provide buses for ActionAid personnel and to mandate his Adviser on Security to arrange with security forces to guarantee security, so that ActionAid teams could carry out their operations effectively.
