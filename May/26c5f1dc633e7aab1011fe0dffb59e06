 Nwankwo  Speaking during the formal inauguration of his mainstream political support group tagged ‘George’s Likeminds’ at his Awka campaign headquarters at the weekend, Moghalu, however, cautioned the electorate to remain vigilant and be wary of empty political promises by desperate aspirants. The Chief Executive of National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) said that youth welfare and empowerment would be his priority as governor. Lamenting the poor state of youth affairs in the state, Moghalu stated that, with jobs, he would tackle the burgeoning restiveness, idleness, insecurity, unemployment, criminality and anti-social behaviours. He listed technical education, sports, skills acquisition and agriculture as some of the areas he would use to stem idleness among the youth, appealing to the APC delegates to give him their votes in the party’s primary to enable him win the main election on November 6, 2021. ON his part, Nwankwo admitted that a new, better and greater Anambra was possible with the support of the party members and voters. Nwankwo told select APC top brass in Awka: “To you, my dear party delegates, electorate and good people of Anambra, I truly believe that everything we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; we’re all teachers. “If we’re willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks, and not wait for some miracle to come knocking at our doors, we will definitely win this election with your support.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
