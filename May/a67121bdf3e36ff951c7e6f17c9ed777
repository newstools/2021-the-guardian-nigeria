The morning routine helps us set the tone for the day, better allowing us to control our schedules rather than our schedule controlling us. As we start each day fresh, we can better focus on what is in front of us, where to prioritize our time, and, ultimately, increase our productivity. A proper morning routine should be about you having some time for self reflection and appreciating yourself. Music is an awesome catalyst to boost your morning routine morale. You can play the music as you do your morning stretches, while jogging or enjoying a hot cup of coffee. The right kind of music builds your morale and psych for the day.
