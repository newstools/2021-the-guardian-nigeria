At the time of her nomination and appointment, Ms. Hadiza Bala Usman came highly recommended. She had served previously as the Chief of Staff to the Kaduna State Government, despite coming from Katsina State.
 
But, somehow, Madam Hadiza’s selection to serve as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigeria Ports Authorities (NPA) was seen as a reward for her roles in the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) that shamed and helped to dethrone the former governing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
 
In July 2016, the former Chief of Staff to Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai was chosen by President Muhammadu Buhari to head the NPA as MD/CEO. Although she secured the President’s approbation for another term in office long before the expiry of the first, on May 6, 2021, two months shy of her fifth year in office, the curtain suddenly fell on her stint in that crucial Maritime sector.  What Went Wrong
ON Thursday may 6, 2021, the former MD of NPA was asked to handover to the Executive Director of Finance and Administration in the Authority, Mohammed Bello-Koko, who is to act as MD, as she proceeds on suspension.
   
In a statement, Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Public Affairs, Mallam Garba Shehu, disclosed that the President approved the recommendation for an administrative panel on the NPA management and the suspension of the MD, Bala-Usman.
 
The suspension, according to Shehu, was to allow an unfettered probe of allegations of impropriety against Madam Hadiza as recommended by the supervising Ministry of Transportation.  Implementation.
After her unsuccessful bid to go to the House of Representatives in 2011, she became part of a non-governmental organisation, the Good Governance Group till opportunity called in Kaduna for the position of Chief of Staff.
   
What next for the enterprising daughter of a prolific socialist? Would she go back to her civil society base to continue advocacy or begin to oil her machineries to have another try at electoral contest? Would El-Rufai take her back?
 
There would be many openings. But first, the outcome of the administrative inquiry would be the base and focus of Nigerians, particularly public intellectuals, who are keeping tab on the Buhari years and the female aides he enlisted.
