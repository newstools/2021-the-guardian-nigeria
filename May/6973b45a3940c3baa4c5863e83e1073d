 Kingsley Moghalu  Leaders of the association in the three geo-political zones of the region converged in Abuja, yesterday, with a resolution that Moghalu should run for President in 2023.
   
 A communiqué presented by chairman of NACTMORA in the 19 northern states, Alhaji Nasiru Ambursa, read in part: “We strongly call on Moghalu to step forward to lead Nigeria. We plead with all Nigerians, for the sake of our children and our future, to support this patriotic Nigerian. He is the man we believe has the vision, capacity and competence to lead Nigeria into a better future.” The commercial riders said they were deeply concerned that “terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, poverty, unemployment, ethnic and religious problems in Nigeria are getting worse since the 2019 general election.”
 
While declaring its non-partisan stance the organisation added: “We are a grassroots trade association with over 10 million members in the 19 northern states. After observing closely the 2019 elections, the trend of Nigerian politics and its major actors, we have concluded that Nigeria, today, is facing a very serious crisis, caused by incompetent leadership, bad governance and corruption, while Nigerian politicians serve themselves and not the people.
 
Those who signed the resolution at the press conference include Zaharadeen Ismail (Chairman, Zamfara chapter), Aliyu Mohammad (Chairman, Abuja), Patrick Agyaba (Chairman, Benue), Sirajo Adamu (Chairman, Kebbi) and Sanusi Usma (Chairman, Katsina).
 
Others are Abdullahi Babayo (Chairman, Kaduna); Abubakar Dalhatu (Chairman, Sokoto) and Saliss Balarabe (Chairman, Taraba chapter)  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
