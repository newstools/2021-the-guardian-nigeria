Images from the fire service show debris from the cabin in a wooded area where a steep slope makes access difficult. The 20-minute cable car ride, popular with tourists, links Stresa with the 1,500-metre (4,900-foot) summit of the Mottarone mountain, which offers spectacular views of the Alps. The accident, which occurred around 300 metres from the summit, may have been caused by a broken cable at the top of the system, the Ansa news agency said. It said 11 people were in the cabin that fell.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
