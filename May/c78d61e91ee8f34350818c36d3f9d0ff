The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has clarified that subscribers are not required to submit their International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.
  
NCC, in a statement yesterday signed by its Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ike Adinde, while reacting to media reports that subscribers would be forced to submit their IMEI numbers, appealed to the public to disregard the reports. He, however, added that it is pertinent to state that the Commission is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS), which would essentially protect subscribers against phone theft, identify and enable the elimination of fake devices from the networks.
 
The system, he noted, would capture IMEI automatically without any requirement for subscribers to submit same.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
