The EU says Borrell has been conducting “intense” diplomatic efforts to try to help de-escalate the violence — holding talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and the top diplomats from neighbouring nations. “The EU’s priority and message in this context remains clear: violence must end now,” the bloc’s foreign  service said in a statement Saturday. The EU’s 27 nations often struggle to find a common position over the conflict with some members including Germany, Austria and Slovenia firmly supporting Israel’s right to defend itself and others urging it show greater restraint.
