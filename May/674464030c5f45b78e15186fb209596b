As of today, 1,134,424 candidates have so far registered. “Stakeholders undertook on the spot assessment of the CBT centres and discovered lapses which warranted the extension. “The challenges among others include candidates non-compliance with registration requirements, using the wrong format to generate profile code and using multiple phone numbers, among others,” he said.
