Addressing journalists at the pre-listing media interactive session in Lagos today, Dukia Gold’s Chairman, Tunde Fagbemi noted that the listing remained one of the ways to diversify Nigeria’s sources of foreign exchange at this critical period of Nigeria’s economy. “We are proud to be the first gold company whose products would be listed on the Lagos Futures and Commodities Exchange. The listing shall enable us to facilitate our infrastructure development, expand capacity and create fungible products. This has the potential to shore up Nigeria’s foreign reserve and create an alternative window for the preservation of pension funds. Gold-backed security is a hedge against inflation and convenient preservation of capital. “We have refinery services to smelt metals with the capacity to meet local and international demand. As a global player, we comply with the practices and procedures of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and many other international bodies. Our refinery will also have multiplier effects on the development of rural areas anywhere it is located. There must be constant power supply, good road network and other social amenities, apart from employment opportunities for the rural dwellers,” says Fagbemi.
