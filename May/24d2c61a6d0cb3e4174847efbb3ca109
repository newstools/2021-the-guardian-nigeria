The first civilian governor of Plateau State, the late Solomon Daushep Lar, would not be happy with the way politics is being played if he were to be alive.
   
Professor Mary Lar, his wife, stated this, yesterday while marking her 86th birthday at Church of Christ In Nations (COCIN), Jos.  “Why don’t we do the right thing? People enjoy making deliberate mistakes. But they forget that we are answerable to God, our Creator.”
     
She said there is a wide gulf between the Nigeria she met and present Nigeria, adding that Nigerians nowadays have abandoned what is right, but keep pursuing the wrong things. On her political journey with her husband when he was alive, Lar said while her husband was busy with people and politicians, she was busy in the house.
    
“As a professor of education, my husband gave me free hand to do my teaching and not to mix it with politicking. I also enjoyed the free latitude I had,” she stated. She pointed out that her 86-year journey on earth has been very effective, giving thanks to Almighty God for what He has done for her.
