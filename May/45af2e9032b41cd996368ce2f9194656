The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote sustainable private sector development in Africa.
  
The memorandum of understanding will help catalyse new sources of financing to help bridge the $2.5 trillion annual financing gap for development in Africa. The gap requires that development finance institutions work in partnership. 
  
In Nigeria alone, borrowing to close the financing gap has ballooned the country’s total public debt to about N32.9 trillion as of December 2020, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO).  “The new partnership agreement between our two institutions will pave the way for us to do more together, especially in supporting the growth of Africa’s private sector. The impact of Covid-19 on government resources is huge and we need to mobilise more private resources to help African countries build back stronger,” said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, signing the memorandum with his counterpart, EBRD President, Odile Renaud-Basso.
