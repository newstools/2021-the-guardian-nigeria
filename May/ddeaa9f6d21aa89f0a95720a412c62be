 FUOYE  For a very long time in Nigeria for example, this tradition of a university was sustained, making a visit to any of them, like a pilgrimage every child or parents would want to make. To sustain the tradition, these universities were made to be self-sufficient in virtually everything they needed, especially, the essential ones; members of the academic staff, the non-academic staff and the students were able to access or procure all essential items they needed without having to go to the host communities. This is not to say that some of them, especially, members of staff were not occasionally going to the markets, however, their contacts with members of host communities, were not frequent as it is today, making the public place them in high regard.
  
Also for students, living off-campus was a very rare incident, as there were sufficient hostel accommodations for them, unlike today where the reverse is the case. Students’ feedings were highly subsidised that some students smuggled in their friends outside the campus, to eat while some students refused to travel home during vacations.
  
To sustain their semi-autonomous life pattern, most (if not all) of the universities had internally generated pipe-borne water ran throughout the campuses and alternative sources of electricity during a power outage. Aside from that some of them had bakeries, a large chunk of the food was from their farms, they had Printing Press where big-notes, jotters and the likes were produced and sold at cheaper prices in their world-class book-shops, their butteries sold drinks at cheaper prices, just as some of them ran super-markets or made some of the then famous super-markets like Leventis Stores to open branches on their campuses.
