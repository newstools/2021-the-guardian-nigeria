Gerontocracy, plutocracy, aristocracy, mobocracy, kakistocracy, kratocracy, and democracy are some of the types of government we have in our today’s world. However, democracy, or representative government, is said to be the best type of government. Now, almost every country on earth is practicing democracy. It is said that the most benevolent military regime is worse than the most repressive civilian or democratic government.
 
That is the chief reason why a military regime in a country is seen as an aberration, anachronism, and misnomer. And, most countries, which have military governments, have been given pariah status. They are ostracized; and, sanctions are imposed on them. Military leaders in countries with military governments do formulate and initiate political transition programmes to facilitate the transfer of power to politicians. Military governments ought to be stop-gap measures and corrective regimes that exist for the stabilization of troubled political polities.  Okoye, a poet wrote from Uruowulu – Obosi
