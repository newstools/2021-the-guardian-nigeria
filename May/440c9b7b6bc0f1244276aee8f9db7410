He noted that the combined effort of the state fire service, residents, and security agents prevented the fire from razing other offices. “Operatives attached to the Division immediately raced to the scene, while contacting Fire Service Office in the area to promptly put out the fire,” Ndukwe said. “The Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, has ordered the cordoning off of the scene and launch of thorough investigation to further ascertain the actual cause of the fire outbreak and damages incurred.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
