The FCTA Permanent Secretary, Olusade Adesola, disclosed this yesterday when some members of the Nigerian Youth Parliament led by the Minority Leader, Daniel Uwadia, visited him in Abuja. Adesola noted that if the youths were effectively carried along in national affairs, restiveness and other vices that destroy values would be reduced to the barest minimum or completely eradicated. According to him, youths were veritable assets to every nation, and the roles they play were key to economic development and growth. He stressed: “From my days in the Ministry of Youths and Sports, I have come to the conclusion that youths are very key and strategic to the development of every society. They have been very resourceful to men and the ministry as well. Even here at the FCTA, the youths remain very strategic to the development of the territory.” Uwadia, who presented a congratulatory plaque to the Permanent Secretary, said the gesture was in recognition of his sterling qualities that helped to motivate the youths. The Edo State representative at the parliament said his group was in Abuja to congratulate the permanent secretary on his transfer to FCTA.
