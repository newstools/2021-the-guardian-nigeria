Struggle For New Nation Legitimate – Gani Adams Recently some Southwest leaders in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) met in Lagos and implored groups involved in agitations for self-determination to desist forthwith. Their position have, however, triggered several reactions form concerned Yoruba groups and individuals.
 
In the second of nine resolutions arrived at the meeting, convener, Chief Bisi Akande expressed strong opposition to separatist agitations and hate speeches. The leaders directed those indulging in such to desist forthwith while expressing their belief in the unity, stability and sustainability of the country.
 
But there have been mixed feelings that the Southwest leaders failed to engage the separatists groups on how take the country out of its present security predicament, which is believed to have been aggravated by the menace of armed Fulani herdsmen, whose activities have been perceived as threat to the existence of other ethnic groups in the country, especially the southern region.  Mixed Reactions Over Resolution Two
DESPITE the perceived internal misgivings within the party about the exclusive tendency of the meeting, there are also discordant tunes over the directives of the Southwest APC leaders to the agitators to desist forthwith.
   
Urging Yoruba to disregard the directives, Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum, a group that has redirected its adherence to the ruling party, said the position of the Southwest APC leaders was not binding on the agitators.
 
President of Yoruba Ronu, Mr. Akin Malaolu said decisions calming down frayed nerves, will further offend the rights of some agitators to be heard.
  
According to him, “We as leaders of thought in the Southwest, find the silence on national dialogue as not only intended to erode the rights of our helpless masses to clamour for justice, equity and fairness, but to also stop completely some agitations for a brand new Constitution on how we shall live together with little or no rancour.”  The forum, however, suggested that President Buhari should give assurances on the way forward in achieving peace and to also fast track the processes of change or in the alternative suspension of the review of 1999 Constitution and the setting up of a government of national unity, leading to postponement of 2023 election.
 
The forum added that any leader or leaders should not delude themselves that they call the shots. “It will be a mistake on their path by putting Nigeria in harm’s way. Peace must not elude us.”
 
In similar vein, the Aare Onakankanfo, Iba Gani Adams raised the alarm that some group of politicians wanted to infiltrate Yoruba nation’s struggle for emancipation.
   
The Yoruba warlord’s concern came on the heels of the Southwest APC leaders’ directives to the agitators. According to Adams, “Prominent politicians in the southwest have now infiltrated the struggle for the actualisation of Yoruba nation. The struggle for actualisation of O’odua Republic is a legitimate right of all Yoruba sons and daughters but top politicians in the southwest had hijacked the struggle.
