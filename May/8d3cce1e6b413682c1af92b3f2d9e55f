The state government said the names of the three nurses involved have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice Labour unions in the state on Monday began a five-day warning strike over the sacking of local government workers. The leaders of various labour bodies protested through Kaduna metropolis to ground operations at ministries, parastatal and agencies. All the commercial banks, transporters, traders, petrol stations attendants and others withdrew their services in the metropolis. Major parts of Kaduna are experiencing a total blackout of electricity due to the strike. Airports have also been grounded with hospitals, schools and other working sectors on lockdown. Governor Nasir El-Rufai on Tuesday declared the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Ayuba Wabba and other executives wanted for alleged economic sabotage. El-Rufai also ordered the Ministry of Health to compile names of nurses below grade level 14 who participated or participating in the ongoing strike action embarked upon by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) for dismissal. He said any academic staff of the Kaduna State University who fails to report for work will also be dismissed.
