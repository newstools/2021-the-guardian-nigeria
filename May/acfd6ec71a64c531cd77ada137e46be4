Lady Cranes XV coach Leonard Lubambula has today announced the 30-woman squad for the second camp of the national team.  A squad of 32 players was summoned for the first camp in Jinja last week from which two trial games were played. It is from this camp that players were evaluated for national team selection. “The selected 30 players are going to drive us to the set goal for this year’s campaign. The team is a mixture of experienced and new players which gives a solid step into next year’s 2022 campaign that starts the rugby World Cup cycle.”- Coach Leonard Lubambula Selected team: Forwards Backs Management  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Uganda Rugby Union.
