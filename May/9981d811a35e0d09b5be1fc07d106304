• To keep petrol price at N162 for fear of protests • Marketers want full deregulation • More trouble for states over minimum wage, sliding IGR
• How govt frustrates PPPRA’s seven-year subsidy exit plan • LCCI says subsidy difficult to police, poses major corruption risk Worried about social resistance that might trail the removal of petrol subsidy, there are indications that the Federal Government will not tamper with the price of petrol anytime soon until tensions abate and food inflation tamed, The Guardian has learnt.
 
To avoid a repeat of another ENDSARS crisis that was already leading to calls for certain governance issues in the country, the Federal Government is hesitant on allowing labour protests to hold.
 
The Guardian had exclusively reported last month that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered that petrol subsidy should remain in place for the next five to six months to enable government carry out wide consultations before reaching a final decision on the issue.
 
Insiders familiar with the negotiations between the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Federal Government on subsidy removal said while full deregulation is expected to commence in lieu of fiscal challenges, the impact of last EndSARS crisis lingers in the minds of policy makers.  ALSO, there are troubles ahead for state governments that are yet to begin the implementation of the new national minimum wage as only 16 states are presently implementing the law. Another trouble for states is the sliding Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), which is expected to slide further this year.
