The statement read: “Concerned about the persisting security challenges in parts of the country, Mr. President summoned a crucial meeting of the National Security Council today (yesterday) as he continues to frontally confront the situation in the country. “At today’s (yesterday) meeting, the President made it abundantly clear that while the insurgents, bandits, and criminals are still at it, he has no doubt that the Nigerian security agencies and all of us as a nation will certainly overcome all the current security problems and defeat the forces of evil marauding about in different parts of the country. “While the criminals continue to test the will of the Nigerian government, the President and the Council, which adjourned today’s critical meeting until Tuesday morning to receive further briefings from the security chiefs, are set and determined to decisively end the assault on the nation and will do all that it takes. “Mr. President is very prepared to take profound measures in the wider interest of the people and the Nigerian nation. There shall be no relenting until peace and security are significantly restored in our communities.” Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Defence, Maj-Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd); National Security Adviser (NSA) to the President, Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), attended the meeting held at the First Lady Conference room, as the Council Chambers was still undergoing renovation. Others in attendance were Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amoo and acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Alkali. The meeting came following rising insecurity in different parts of the country and general outcry for urgent action from the President to stem the tide. Several Nigerians have either been killed or kidnapped in different parts of the country, creating panic among citizens, including residents of Abuja, the capital city. Niger Governor Abubakar Bello had during the week disclosed that Boko Haram terrorists had overrun 50 communities in Kaure and Shiroro local councils of the state and hoisted their flag. The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday, also backed the House of Representatives position, urging the President to immediately declare a state of emergency on security in the country. The party further urged the President to convoke a national conference on security to collate and harmonise options on how to tackle the deteriorating insecurity in the country.
