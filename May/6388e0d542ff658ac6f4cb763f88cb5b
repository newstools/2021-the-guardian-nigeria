In his Eid-El-Fitri message to Muslims, yesterday, Obasa, who called for more patriotism, said: “Nigerians should see the current challenges confronting the country as an opportunity to be further united. This is a sure way to national progress.” To him, the security and economic challenges Nigeria is facing at the moment are temporary situations from which the country would come out stronger. He advised President Buhari to urgently act on the requests recently made by the Southern Governors’ Forum as a way to curb rising insecurity in the country. “President Buhari should not only give a thought to the requests made by the governors, he should also act on them for the country to move forward.” “This year’s Ramadan afforded many of us opportunity to pray for the country. It is obvious that Nigeria has some challenges, which should not be left to the government alone. Every Nigerian is important and must play that positive role that would ultimately move the country from where it is now to where we want it to be. “More than ever, we have the responsibility to make the country habitable, devoid of criminal elements, and we must be resolute on this.” Also, a Lagos socio-political activist, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, said the southern governors should immediately begin action on their resolutions. Applauding the governors, Onitiri said they had waited for too long while their states were being deliberately ravaged by armed Fulani herdsmen and other blood-tasty, hardened criminals, making life difficult for everybody. “The most insulting aspect of the matter is that the farmers are being attacked, maimed, killed or kidnapped for ransom. As if that is not enough, the farmers are being sent out of their farms, their produce destroyed, and their wives and daughters raped as if Nigerians are in a Banana Republic.” According to Onitiri, the fallout of all these is famine being caused in the south deliberately by people who claim that Nigeria belongs to them. “It is in the light of this that all patriots and democrats and indeed all lovers of Nigeria implore the 17 southern governors that adopting the 10-point resolution is not enough, but to walk the talk of their resolutions. We are in full support of their resolutions, they were all being expected by Nigerians. It is better late than never,” Onitiri said.
