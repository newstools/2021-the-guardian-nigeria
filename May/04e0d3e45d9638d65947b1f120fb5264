 The canal  There are indications that the Lagos State Government may be constrained to close the multi-billion naira Ladipo International Spare Parts Market in Mushin over alleged environmental infractions.  But, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, said the state might take the unpopular path if the market leaders failed to do the needful.
  
Such actions, he said, would be necessary to protect the environment because of its importance to the sustainability of the human race.
 
Odumboni said the state had intervened several times at the market and would continue to do so because of its location.  “We collect a minimum of 17 tipper loads of plastics in the canals and drains daily. There has been a major improvement from what it used to be. “If you see a decline in the volume of plastics, it is because we are intervening in them,” he added.
  
But the President-General, Ladipo Central Executive Auto Dealers Association (LCEADA), Jude Nwankwo, said the canals are always cleared during the Thursday weekly environment sanitation in the market.
 
He stressed that they have been pratronising the PSP operators, but the problem was that some of them were not even coming to cart away the waste.
 
According to him, the problem in Ladipo is caused by the local government authorities, which give contracts based on political patronage and not on competence.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
