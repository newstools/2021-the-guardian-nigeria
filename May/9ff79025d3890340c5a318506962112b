Randle handed down the warning on the sidelines of the Club recent celebration of accomplishments and presentation of awards to four Club’s ICONS, where members also passed a vote of confidence on his leadership and pledged to support his programmes. He said the Club is taking extra steps to contribute to the management of stress in the country, particularly in Lagos State, where it is located. Beyond fear, stress and anxiety created by socio-economic calamities, Randle also listed personal lifestyle habits that should be checked by individuals to prevent or manage strain. Among them are excessive eating, lack of recreational practices and an unhealthy environment. The President also called on the government at all levels to tackle the menace of socio-economic factors fuelling stress in the land and support organizations like Ikeja Club, which are committed to combating stress. He said, “In response to the growing stress in the land. We at Ikeja Club have been expanding our recreational facilities to accommodate more members and the public. The expansion followed a thorough survey and inputs by experts on how best to provide recreation for Nigerians across ages, sexes and lifestyles. “At Ikeja Club, we are very scientific and methodological in our decisions and actions towards achieving our cardinal objectives of bringing about a fit and healthy society. Our facilities are approved and managed by experts. “But our efforts would amount to nought if the people we provide these facilities do not use them. That is why we have been urging Nigerians and even non-Nigerians to take advantage of our selfless offers.” He debunked the notion by a section of the public that clubs are places of sin, saying, “Contrary to that notion, clubs have strict rules and regulations that ensure only noble members of the public are admitted. If a member of a club in Nigeria is found guilty of any misconduct, his details will be circulated to other clubs. Discipline and good conduct are hallmarks of Ikeja Club.” In addition to preventing and managing stress, he identified networking, health talks, and promotion of business, among others, as benefits Ikeja Club offers. Prominent among those that passed a vote of confidence on Chief Ayo Randle’s leadership were some of the past Presidents of the Club, Otunba (Engr) Oluwanishola Olaofe, Prince Ademola Adunola and Elder Sunday Ajayi Ajilore JP and Elders of the Club. One of the Goodwill messages posted said: “I commend Chief Ayodeji Randle for the unrelenting vigour and resourcefulness he has committed to not only restoring the glory of Ikeja Club but also transforming it into an institution that can hold its head among peers locally and internationally. “It is most gratifying that since he assumed office, he has demonstrated integrity, transparency and accountability, which are consistent with his pedigree.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
