Onyemelukwe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship hopeful in Anambra State in the November 6 election, Lady Chidi Onyemelukwe, has said she is in the race to serve the state, if voted as governor. Onyemelukwe, who is daughter of the late former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, told journalists in Awka yesterday that the experience gained under her father, while in government had prepared her for governorship of the state, insisting that since she was aspiring for the position, she was ready to offer selfless service. “It is important that I have the experience to serve, to sustain a legacy and get things done the right way. My home is my identity. We need to make Anambra State a home where everybody will be proud,” she said. Onyemelukwe, who recalled the good old days when people were their brothers’ keeper, when there was love for one another, lamented that things had really gone bad, adding: “That is why we have come to make Anambra State habitable again. “My manifesto says it all. Our dear state needs restoration in all facets, because in the last eight years, our people have experienced leadership, trust, fiscal, economic and infrastructure deficits. “My priorities are to restore trust and confidence in leadership and governance, get our state’s infrastructure working again, sustain and protect existing public infrastructure and property, complete viable abandoned projects and place Anambra State on the path to greatness.” She stressed that she desired to give back to society and help build a state Anambra children would be proud to call home, saying: “These days, the young ones are mostly looking for a way out”.
