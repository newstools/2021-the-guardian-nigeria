Despite accounting for approximately 20 per cent of global cassava production, Nigeria’s cassava seed system is bedeviled with low yield of smallholder farmers, among other challenges.
   
A partner at Sahel Consulting, Temitope Adegoroye, who disclosed this during the first cassava business summit, organised by Building an Economically Sustainable and Integrated Cassava Seed System, Phase II (BASICS-II) project and convened by Sahel Consulting, said there are opportunities in the cassava seed system sub-sector to catalyze the country’s agricultural transformation, but the opportunities have not been fully tapped for job creation, income generation and food security. Adegoroye said the need for effective collaboration amongst all cassava stakeholders to maximize the potential in the value chain gave birth to the first edition of the summit.  For the Director-General of Nigeria Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), Dr. Phillip Ojo, the Cassava Seed Business Summit was timely as it arose when Nigeria is faced with challenges that a robust cassava seed sector could address.
A panel session tagged: “Backward Integration Focusing on Cassava Seed Multiplication–The Perspectives of Industrial Processors,” provided a platform to share experiences and examine challenges of industrial processors.
   
A manager at Sahel Consulting, Chinedu Agbara, moderated the panel, which comprised cassava processing industry leaders and experts, namely: Mrs. Yemisi Iranloye, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Psaltry International Limited; Mrs. Nike Tinubu, Executive Director of Eagleson & Nito Concepts Limited and General Manager of Premium Cassava Products Limited (PCPL); Mr. Seyi Oyenuga, Executive Director of ATMANcorp Nigeria Limited; and Mr. Tunde Solaja, Managing Director of Crest Agro Products Limited.
  
In his closing comments, the Project Manager of BASICS-II project, Prof. Lateef Sanni, promised to promote engagement with the private sector actors in cassava seed production, stressing that the private sector was crucial for cassava transformation.
