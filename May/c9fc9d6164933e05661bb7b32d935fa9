A good cause organisation, Dr. Helen a Hand to the Needy Foundation, has provided financial support to small and medium scale entrepreneurs (SMEs). 
 
The Foundation, owned by Dr. Helen Oritsejafor, who recently launched a book titled ‘You Too Can Become a Success’ said the Foundation was committed to imparting knowledge to SMEs across the country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
To further aid struggling businesses, Oritsejafor, at the launch, said 50 per cent of the proceeds from the book sales would be given as grants to business owners through her foundation.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
