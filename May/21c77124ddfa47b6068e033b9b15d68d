Not only has she, by reason of her talent, won recognitions but now the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has offered her a United States online scholarship to horn her art skills. The 27-year-old artiste had presented a pencil portrait of Prof Osinbajo to him during a courtesy visit to the Ooni of Ife in 2020. Abosede Okeowo, an indigene of Otun Ekiti, Mobaland in Ekiti State, suffered an illness when she was a child, which resulted in her current state of health. She is a self-taught artist who, driven by passion, nurtured her talent in drawing to her current stage of expertise. She is known for making drawings of many dignitaries, which has brought her to the limelight. Bose first caught the attention of the vice president when she drew a portrait of his wife, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo.
