An operative of the Department of State Services (DSS) has escaped death after some followers of Chief Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a. Sunday Igboho), a self-acclaimed Yoruba freedom-fighter, attacked the secret police officer for taking picture of the vehicles in Adeyemo’s convoy to Osogbo for the Yoruba nation rally. Sunday Igboho, his followers and other agitators for Yoruba Nation had at the weekend stormed Osogbo, to demand independence of the Yoruba people. After the rally at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, the agitators, led by Sunday ‘Igboho’, moved to the palace of Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, to pay homage and solicit the support of the monarch for their self-determination agitation. The Guardian learnt that some of the boys, who were wearing charms and armed with guns and cutlasses, had allegedly sighted an operative of the DSS taking photograph of number plates of some of the vehicles in Adeyemo’s convoy. The Sunday Igboho’s boys had approached the DSS officer and interrogated him on why he was taking photographs of the vehicles’ number plates. While they were questioning the DSS operative, who gave his name as Seun Olayinka in the video obtained by The Guardian, some other loyalists of Sunday Igboho stormed the scene with cutlasses and started attacking the secret police officer. One of the boys queried the operative on his mission at the palace, and he replied feasibly under duress: “My name is Seun Olayinka, I have been working with the DSS for six years now. I came to join and watch what they are doing there (rally). “I am a Yoruba person. I want to pick the number plate of this vehicle. Chief Sunday Igboho is a nationalist; he is not the one I am here for. “I was arrested for writing down the vehicle’s number plate. I was asked from the office to take note and write down the number plate. I work for the Federal Government. I am from Oyo. I am sorry sir.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
