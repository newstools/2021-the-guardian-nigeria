The COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted movement, adversely affected our players both from travelling to participate in some of the international tournaments they registered for, just as International Tennis Federation (ITF) ranking tournaments were put on hold as well as some of the local tournaments even with the sponsors readily available. “This time, we were lucky to have DavNotch Nigeria Limited responding to our request for a senior championship. “With this DavNotch Senior Championship in our kitty, the federation will go all out to its sponsors to revive the tournaments, especially since COVID-19 restrictions are gradually being relaxed,” Dayo Akindoju said. On the DavNotch competition, Akindoju said the technical officials are considering a draw of 64 for men and 32 for the female. “To be specific, the draws would depend on the number of entries received. For now, 50 players have confirmed their participation and many have been calling to indicate interest. Those calling would only be admitted after receiving their registration,” he added.
