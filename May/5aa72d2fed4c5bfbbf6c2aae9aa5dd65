Investors lose N512b in five trading days Sell pressure ahead of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting has triggered high volatility of equities trading at the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). The all-share index (ASI) and market capitalisation depreciated by 2.93 per cent or N521 billion to close the week at 38,324.07 and N19.975 trillion. Similarly, other indices finished lower except NSE Oil and Gas, NSE Growth and NSE Sovereign Bond indices which appreciated by 7.39 per cent, 0.62 per cent and 3.02 per cent respectively. Analysts predicted a gloomy outlook this week, as investors adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach ahead of any catalyst that will trigger growth. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said:” In the coming week, we expect the bearish sentiment to continue in the absence of any positive catalyst. Codros Capital said:” In the week ahead, we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the highly-anticipated MPC meeting to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the FI market. “Consequently, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading dominates the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally-justified stocks as the weak macroeconomic outlook remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Also, Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “We expect the market to follow a similar pattern next week, with investors adopting a wait-and-see approach in the market ahead of any major catalyst to move the market in either direction.” A breakdown of activities last week showed that the domestic equities market reopened on Monday with a 0.44 per cent loss, following depreciation in many high capitalised stocks. Specifically, the ASI decreased 175.42 basis points, representing a decline of 0.44 per cent to close at 39,306.47 basis points.    Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N92 billion to close at N20.487 trillion. Sector performance was broadly negative with the banking, consumer goods and industrial sectors closing in the red. The downtrend was driven by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks amongst which are; Nigerian Enamelware, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Stanbic IBTC Holdings, BUA Cement and Lafarge Africa. Trading activities on the stock market closed on a downward note, to extend the bearish sentiments to two consecutive trading days, as the ASI dipped by 0.72 per cent. The ASI dropped by 283.95 points, representing a decline of 0.72 per cent to close at 39,022.52 points.
