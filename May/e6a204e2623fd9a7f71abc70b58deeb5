Governor Muhammad Yahaya of Gombe State has described as “agents of doom” those calling for the disintegration of Nigeria. Describing them as unpatriotic, the governor said Nigeria would forever remain as an indivisible nation, no matter the threat and challenges facing it. This was as the Vice Chancellor of Federal University Kashere (FUK), Prof. Umar Pate, stated that it was a threat on its own for some elements to canvass the disembowelment of the country. Hosting the Presidential Visitation Panel led by Pate in the state’s Executive Council Chamber, Yahaya said: “What we need in Nigeria is a re-think, so that everybody will have a fair share. I don’t support anybody calling for the break-up of Nigeria. The unity, peace and progress of Nigeria are not negotiable.” He, however, pointedly stated that regional emancipation groups like Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Oduduwa Republic and ‘Shege Ka-Fasa’ “are not patriotic”. Fielding questions from newsmen, Pate said nothing would make him queue behind anyone calling for the dismemberment of Nigeria.
