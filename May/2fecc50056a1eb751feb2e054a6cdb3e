National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, urged Muslims to use the period of Eid-El-Fitri celebration to pray for sincere and genuine leadership that would save the country from its present socio-economic predicaments. Secondus observed that six years after the nation’s democracy was handed over to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), it has become apparent that Nigeria is in a precarious situation because of glaring absence of leadership at a time it is most needed. The PDP boss said the end of the 30-day Ramadan fasting offered Muslim faithful a good opportunity to reflect on the country’s democracy and pray for its survival. “More than ever before, the country, since 1999, is under heavy stress, which demands that all hands need to be on deck for its survival. The end of the Holy month of Ramadan provides ample opportunity for positive attitude,” he stated. In his Eid-El-Fitri message, Secondus said those in position of authority should use the period to underline the lessons of sacrifice and brotherly love, even as he advised that  “our actions as leaders must not negate the fundamental prescriptions of our faith.” “Most of the problems confronting the ordinary people would have been solved if leaders absorb the lesson of Ramadan and allow it to influence their conduct in and out of office. “The only way the last 30 days of fasting and prayer will be meaningful in our lives as a nation is if we allow the solemnness of the period influence our thoughts and actions in relating with one another.” The PDP chairman urged Nigerians to maintain their harmonious inter-faith relations, for attainment of desired peace, “without which we cannot achieve good governance.” He cautioned leaders to mind their utterances.
