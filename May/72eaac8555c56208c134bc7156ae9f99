The Nigerian Army has denied the allegation that Lance Corporal Adamu Galadima, is a serving soldier. He was allegedly involved in the kidnap and murder of his neighbour’s child after collecting N5 million as a ransom. According to army spokesman, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, Galadima was dismissed from the army in 2013. “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a video, which has gone viral on the social media alleging that a soldier, Lance Corporal Adamu Galadima, was involved in an alleged case of kidnap and murder of his neighbour’s child after collecting the sum of N5 million as ransom. “The Nigerian Army wishes to state that the information contained in the video is not true. Contrary to the claim, Lance Corporal Adamu Galadima was duly dismissed from the army in 2013 after a General Court Marshal that held in Kaduna found him guilty. “His last unit was 2, Provost Group, where he was involved in a case of attempted murder, leading to his arrest and prosecution before the General Court Marshal in Kaduna. “After his dismissal, Adamu found his way to Kaduna State Environmental Services, where he secured a job as a cleaner. “He is, therefore, not a soldier as at April 2021 when he committed the alleged crime. “The Nigerian Army remains a disciplined organisation that will not condone any unprofessional conduct on the part of its officers and soldiers. “The general public is therefore urged to ignore the misleading story currently being shared in the social media.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
