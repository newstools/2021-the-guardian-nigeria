Doctor Usman Bugaje, Dr. Olisa Agbakoba, Prof. Ayo Atsenuwa, Ann-Kio Briggs, Mike Utsaha and Folarin Falana (a.k.a. Falz,) will today dissect issues at the launch of #FixPoliticsDialogues. #FixPolitics spokesperson, Mr. Ozioma Ubabukoh, who made this known to The Guardian, yesterday, in Lagos, said that the platform would be launched online with a debate on ‘1999 Constitution: To Change or Amend?’ Falz of the #EndSARS movement, Cynthia Mbamalu of Not-Too-Young-To-Run, and Saed Hussein will represent the voice of young Nigerians at the inter-generational conversation followed by a referendum. The #FixPoliticsDialogues centres on citizens’ voice and participation in the discussion of the 1999 Constitution. While the National Assembly is pushing forward the agenda for amendment, there is rising crescendo of citizens’ voices demanding a new constitution based on a national conversation. “#FixPoliticsDialogues will serve the purpose of convening healthy debates and dialogues on serious public agenda issues like the 1999 Constitution. It is one of the mandates of #FixPolitics to reform the Nigeria constitutional, political and electoral environment for national development,” Ubabukoh stated. According to him, #FixPolitics is a movement of citizens, by citizens and for citizens.  He encouraged all citizens to join the conversation on the constitutional way forward for Nigeria since no progress is possible without such a fundamental agreement. “This inaugural dialogue on the constitution, as a framework for enshrining and realising our national aspirations is an appropriate beginning,” he added.
