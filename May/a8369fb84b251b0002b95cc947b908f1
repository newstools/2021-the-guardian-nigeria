The event, which is being organised by Energy & Corporate Africa and expected to take place in August is pegged on the backdrop of the global trends fuelling energy transition. Chief Executive Officer of Energy & Corporate Africa, Sunny Oputa noted that while Africa readies to position itself for the paradigm shift in global perspective of the oil and gas industry, the event would offer insights into critical steps and strategies that could set the continent on the right track. “While the new clamour from industry experts remain that Africa as most developing economies should be given fossil fuel space to advance its economy and catch up with developed economies through investments, project funding, technologies, digitalization and manpower development, there is also a new call that Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa should tap into the surging gas economy and develop its gas assets as the global demand increases,” he noted. Oputa noted that the Minister of Petroleum and Energy from Gambia, top executives from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, those from Ghana National Oil company, Senegal oil company, Shell Nigeria, Total Nigeria, Seplat and other stakeholders have been confirmed for the event. The event would also bring together other ministers of petroleum from sub-Saharan Africa, oil and gas producing nations and new frontiers as Tony Attah, the Managing Director/CEO of NLNG is expected to deliver the keynote address at the event.
