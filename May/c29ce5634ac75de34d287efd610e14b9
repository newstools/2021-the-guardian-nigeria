The traditional ruler of Candos community in Ipaja area of Lagos, Chief Moruf Owonla, has petitioned the House of Representatives and Police Service Commission (PSC), Abuja, over unnecessary harassment and detention at Area K Police Command, Badagry. In the petition written by Owonla’s counsel, Remi Adeoye, the monarch alleged that a police officer attached to Area K command, Kingsley Anyanwu, ordered his detention, based on false complaints by trespassers on his landed property, The petitioner said Anyanwu humiliated him claiming that he failed to fulfill a monetary gift he promised him before he was transferred from Ayobo police division. The petition also alleged that Anyanwu’s ‘indiscretion’ was backed by the Lagos Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who on May 5, 2021, withdrew and detained four police details approved for his company, Rosebol Petroleum Limited by the Inspector General of Police (IGP). “Upon this discovery, our client sought to have an audience with Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, so as to explain the circumstances that led to the dispute between our client and CSP Kingsley Anyanwu but the Commissioner of Police refused to grant our client any audience and he also failed to create any avenue to listen to our client,” the petitioner added. When contacted, the police spokesman, Mr. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, promised to revert to our reporter. He, however, did not do so as at press time.
