You gave me the cameras to shoot my first pilot and all through my career treated me as a son and an equal even I was never on your level. You used to tease me when my team lost and told me repeatedly how proud you were of me. My heart is ripped apart. pic.twitter.com/gAP6jUyOtZ — Imoh (@ImohUmoren) May 22, 2021  Actress Kate Henshaw Oh no…..Biodun is dead…. — Kate Henshaw (@HenshawKate) May 22, 2021  This man carefully pointed out my errors, advised me and directed me to the right sources when I was learning how to write a script.
