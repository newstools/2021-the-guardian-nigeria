The Senior Pastor, Foundation of Truth Assembly, Reverend Yomi Kasali, has appealed to those agitating for self-determination and disintegration of Nigeria to reconsider their stand. He said what Nigeria needs now is deep thinkers, who can reinvent it and take it out of its present precarious condition.
    
Speaking at a praise service/book launch to commemorate Pastor Motunrayo Alaka’s birthday in Lagos, Kasali said the dearth of positive thinkers has been the bane of Nigeria’s development.
 
He said if Nigeria had deep thinkers, the country would not be where it is today. “It is not the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the major opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) or any other party that will resolve it, our challenges could only be addressed purely by good morals.”  “We must not demonise the Ibos because they are fantastic, we must not also stigmatize the Fulani/Hausa because they have their values while also the Yoruba race have their qualities. If we are deep thinkers, we will look at issues sincerely and see how to move this nation forward.”
   
The cleric lamented that one of the country’s biggest setbacks is ethnic and personal interest. “Most often, when we speak, we think first based on ethnic and religious sentiments and then the craze for corruption is another big problem.”
    
Alaka also use the event to call on Nigerians to ensure that the country remains one. According to her: “Nigeria’s potential far outweighs all that tends towards her division. There is inherent strength in diversity and cultural values. We must therefore ensure that the country’s unity must be preserved. Nigeria is all that we have and we have everything that it takes to have a great nation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
