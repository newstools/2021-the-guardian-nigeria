Many residents, who have been without power supply since Tuesday till when this report was filed, lamented the situation, urging the government to address it.
  
Consumers lamented that the situation has impacted on their businesses, citing the case of Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC) that has been mum on reasons for the blackout.  The Guardian reported that the nation’s electricity grid collapsed, on Tuesday, plunging parts of the country. “We regret to inform you that the power outage currently being experienced across our franchise – Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states – is a result of the collapse of the national grid,” Kaduna Electric said on Twitter.
 
Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc, in a text message to its customers, said: “Dear customer, there is a partial system collapse on the national grid. Our TCN partners are working to restore supply immediately. Please bear with us.” Also, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), in a statement titled “System collapse and grid recovery” and signed by the General Manager (Public Affairs), NdidiMbah, explained that the blackout was a result of voltage collapse at some parts of the grid.
 
“TCN commenced grid recovery immediately after the collapse, from Shiroro Generating Station to Katampe TS, Abuja through the Shiroro – Katampe line at 11:29 am, and also through Delta Generating Station to Benin Transmission Substation and has reached Osogbo and parts of Lagos.
  
“While the grid restoration and power restoration gradually progress to other parts of the country, the cause of voltage collapse that precipitated this failure is equally being investigated.”
  
Though TCN had hinted that 90 per cent restoration was confirmed by 9pm on Tuesday, major areas under the jurisdictions of some Distribution Companies still don’t have power supply as at the time of filing this report.
