The president of Africa Mini-Football Confederation, Achraf Ben Salha, has expressed satisfaction at the Ilaji Sports Resort, Ibadan, venue of the confederation’s forthcoming second Nations Cup.
 
Salha, a Tunisian, who is also the vice president of the World Mini-Football Federation, was accompanied on the inspection tour of the facilities by Tarik Zakaria, a member of AMC.
 
“I have seen fantastic facilities at Ilaji. The facilities in the hostel and hotel for the players and officials were of world class. The only places that I have seen such facilities are in the United States of America, Dubai and Germany among some of the countries that I have visited where mini-football is played. The uniqueness of the facilities at Ilaji Sports Resort is that all the facilities are in the same enclosure on a verse land, and that would reduce stress on the players, as they would come out of their rooms and walk straight to the pitch without waiting for official vehicle,” he said. Ibadan will host the second Africa Mini-Football Confederation Nations Cup from July 8 to 17. The Tunisian disclosed that about 26 countries, including defending champions, Cote d’Ivoire, would attend the competition as against 20 entries that earlier sent their entries. Chairman of the Nigeria Mini-Football Association, Oluyemi Adewale Taiwo said all hands are on the deck to ensure successful hosting of the tournament.
