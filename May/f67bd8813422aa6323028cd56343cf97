Officials opened an investigation while the bodies were transported to the medical examiner. Michoacan, located along the Pacific coast, is facing a wave of violence linked to ongoing clashes between criminal gangs fighting over drug trafficking routes. Last month, eight decapitated bodies were found in a mountainous area of the Aguililla region, where attacks by the Jalisco New Generation cartel have been reported. More than 300,000 people have been killed in Mexico since December 2006, when the federal government launched a controversial military campaign against drug trafficking, according to official numbers, most of which are attributed to criminal actions.
