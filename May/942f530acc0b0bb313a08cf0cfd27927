 [FILES] Reverend father Mbaka and Muhammadu Buhari  The first-stage hardship was steered by the template as any policy that affects the circulation of money may lead to hardship in the interim. Again, the administration should be cheered- for the first time in history, as citizens under SME (Small-and-Medium Scale Enterprises) have been accessing loans from the federal government as practiced in advanced countries without tips or the usual ‘man-no-man’ syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic that even shook strong economies of the world did the worst by compounding the hardships already in the society from policy reforms, as many lost jobs and countless businesses closed down after the lockdown due to lack of resources. Buhari should possibly seek external support as the crisis is going out of hands. People are hungry and suffering, and even farmers cannot freely go to their farms. In fact, the system requires radical actions now. This is the reason that as 2023 draws closer, it is germane to begin to think deeper about the leadership of the country. The numerous crisis demands a leader with vast experiences on management to succeed President Buhari. Umegboro is a public affairs analyst and Associate, Chartered Institute of Arbitration (UK).
