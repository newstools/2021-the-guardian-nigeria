Attahiru was released after his parents negotiated with the kidnappers and paid a ransom Voice Of America (VOA) Hausa reported. The student’s mother Lauretta Attahiru, who confirmed the development to journalists on Tuesday did not elaborate on the release of her son. Twenty-two undergraduates were seized from their campus almost two weeks ago by gunmen. Five of them have since been killed by the captors. In an interview with the VOA Hausa, the leader of the team, Sani Idris Jalingo (also known as Baleri), handed down the threat to kill the remaining students by Tuesday if they refused to pay the ransom. He explained that affected parents had paid N55 million which they allegedly used in feeding the captives. “There are 15 females and two males in our captivity, including the son of the late Emir, Shehu Idris, identified as Hamza,” Jalingo said “We have heard the governor ranting that he would not pay a kobo as ransom to any bandit or kidnapper. “He even warned his family members that should anyone of them be kidnapped, he wouldn’t pay a kobo to free them.” The ringleader said they eliminated the five students to show seriousness and the government’s failure to pay the N100 million ransom might lead to the death of the remaining students.
