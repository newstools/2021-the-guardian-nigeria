Make way for Jody as he becomes the latest signee under Nigerian Afro-dance artist, Skales’s OHK Entertainment imprint. And Jody is going hard with his entry as he makes his introduction with a TUC-produced tune dubbed Nonstop. <img loading="lazy" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Non-Stop-artwork-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1413911 lazyload" /> Nonstop is as emotive as it is catchy. The song finds Jody baring his feelings and making a pledge of unending love to a significant other. This is Jody’s first single under the Skales-led label and the first from the new artists’ upcoming EP slated for a June 2021 release. Click here to listen to Nonstop
