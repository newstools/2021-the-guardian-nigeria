Five or six men beat and pepper-sprayed the 29-year-old man late Thursday, a police spokesperson said. One man was arrested. Jonathan Greenblatt, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said that since the latest outbreak of fighting, there has been a spike in anti-Semitic acts in the United States. He pointed to a number of incidents in several states, including two incidents this week in Los Angeles, where supporters of the Palestinians attacked Jewish men sitting outside a restaurant, and also threw bottles at homes of Jews that had the traditional mezuzah parchment on their doors. “We have seen a dangerous and drastic spike in anti-Semitism here at home in just the past week to 10 days,” said Greenblatt.
