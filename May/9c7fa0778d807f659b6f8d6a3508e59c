What a time to be a musician in this country — Pam-Hworo (@Jhoy_gurl) May 28, 2021  Rotimi Amaechi couldn’t even be agile in his singing like Dino Melaye. Kogi 1 : 0 Rivers. Waiting for a governor to do theirs. — Osaretin Victor Asemota (@asemota) May 29, 2021  Born Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, Amaechi currently serves as the Minister of Transportation in the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. He previously served in oil-rich Rivers State as Governor of Rivers State from 2007 to 2015 and Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2007. This is not the first time that a politician would be taking on a musical career. In 2017, Dino Melaye came under fire for featuring in a music video depicting his lavish lifestyle. The former senator and member of the 8th Nigerian National Assembly, representing Kogi West Senatorial district was featured in a song titled “Dino” by rap artiste Kash.
