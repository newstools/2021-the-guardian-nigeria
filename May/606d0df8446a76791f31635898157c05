Filani said that 52,960 doses of the vaccines, earlier delivered to the state, were duly utilised. He reiterated the commitment of the current administration to the provision of quality and accessible health care to the citizenry. The commissioner added that the state would leave no stone unturned toward ensuring that people are vaccinated. He advised residents to take advantage of governmentâ€™s gesture to get vaccinated, stressing that getting immunised remained the most effective way to checkmate the virus. He also appealed that people should continue to adhere to required public health and social measures outlined by government to curtail the spread of the virus. Filani added that wear facemask in public gatherings, maintain hand hygiene through proper hand washing, use of alcohol based sanitizers and social distancing even after receiving the vaccines remained sacrosanct.
