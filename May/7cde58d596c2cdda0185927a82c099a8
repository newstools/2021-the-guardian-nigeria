Speaking before teeing off the competition, Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu urged the participants to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship while competing for laurels. He also advised them to enjoy the hospitality of the people, as well as make out time to visit major shopping centres in Aba to buy their take-home memorabilia. Ikpeazu promised to continue to support the sport, assuring that his administration would build a new golf course at Ohafia to further deepen golfing awareness. “I pray that Golf, which is a unifying game, will continue to unify us in Nigeria and also avail us of the health benefits of engaging in this gentlemen’s game,” Ikpeazu remarked. Earlier, Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria’s (PGAN) Director of Competitions, Mr. Johnbull Dangofa, who was among the first participants to arrive in the state to ensure smooth take-off of the championship, informed the governor that having gone round the historic city, he was pleased with the prevailing peace and the good infrastructure in place in Aba. He added: “Honestly, the Aba I met shocked me contrary to what we read and hear in Abuja and Bayelsa, where I come from. I have been walking the streets of Aba and nobody has harassed or disturbed me.” President of Aba Sports Club, Chief Jerry Kalu, said his members were grateful to the governor for supporting to ensure the smooth run and success of the competition.
