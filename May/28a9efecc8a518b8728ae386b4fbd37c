Yoruba youths under the aegis of Yoruba Youth Socio-cultural Association (YYSA) Worldwide, have warned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over the plan to attack soft targets in Lagos State. The warning was contained in a statement signed by its National President, Olalekan Hammed. Hammed said Lagos is not part of Biafra, hence, the state should not be targeted for attacks. “We are hereby saying it unequivocally that IPOB should dare not attack Lagos and other Southwest states,” Hammed said. “Yoruba land is neither part of southeast nor Biafra, why should any part of our region be their target?” He warned against the repeat of the EndSARS protest that led to the burning of properties in Lagos. “We can never allow repeat of ENDSAR destruction in Yorùbá land again instead, it would be battle to finish,” Hammed said. “Lagos is the heart of Southwest geo-political zone and Nigeria generally, without her, we are nothing in terms of economy. “YYSA implores youths accross the region most especially the OPC, Àgbẹ́kọ̀yà, hunters, Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn, vigilante and other Yoruba militia groups to stay alert to resist any attempt by IPOB to attack Lagos and other Southwest states. “We must collectively fight against external forces that have the motive of exterminating our economy.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
