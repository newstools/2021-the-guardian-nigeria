The Nigeria Olympians Association (NOA) has chosen former international tennis star, Prof. Sadiq Abdullahi as the co-chairman and ambassador at its forum and banquet ceremony billed for June 24 at the NAF Conference Centre and Suites, Abuja. According to NOA, Abdullahi was chosen for the positions in recognition of his valuable contributions to youth and sports development. “With this appointment,” according to NOA, Abdullahi “becomes its spokesperson in the Diaspora and elsewhere.” In a letter to Abdullahi, the NOA explained that it works “to bring together past and current Olympians, who have represented the country with dignity and honour. To assist former Olympians to transition to a life beyond competing sports following retirement.” According to the NOA, “there are over 1500 Olympians since the inception of a Nigerian team at the Olympics in the 1950s. Nigeria Olympians are committed to promoting and advancing the sports reform agenda of the current administration- Sports infrastructure, Grassroots Development, Athletes Welfare, and Sports as a Business. These areas will be explored at the June 24 NOA Forum and Awards ceremony breakout session.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
