According to the exchange, the campaign will kick off with a webinar on Tuesday, May 18, 2021, and will amplify NGX Group’s new brand identity and the growth potential of the African continent across traditional and digital media. The campaign will focus on the successful demutualisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) which led to the emergence of NGX Group and its three subsidiaries – Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, NGX Regulation (NGX RegCo) Limited and NGX Real Estate (NGX RelCo) Limited. Commenting on the campaign, the Group Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Oscar Onyema said: “As we step into the NGX era, we remain committed to the highest level of competitiveness, both in African and global capital markets. He said the campaign was designed to impress that the exchange is fully equipped and better positioned to champion the development of new and improved experiences for the benefit of domestic, regional and foreign stakeholders. “We are excited to show the world that we embody the same traits of ambition, strength, innovation and excellence that distinguish the African continent, and we are confident that these qualities will see us thrive in an era of endless possibilities. “Built around the new corporate identity, the campaign emphasises the vibrancy and dynamism of NGX Group and its subsidiaries. It provides stakeholders with an immersive experience through creative messaging and opportunities for direct engagement with the brand.” “Our goal is not only to celebrate this pivotal point in our journey but to also show our stakeholders that we are ready and able to explore new frontiers in our quest to be the partner and platform of choice for meeting their business, financial and investment objectives”, Onyema said.
