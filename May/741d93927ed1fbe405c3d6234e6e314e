So, it is three crashes in three months, as the first and third clashes occurred exactly three months apart, February 21 and May 21. As many continued to input different insinuations around the plane crashes, the military and federal government especially through its agencies should be able to tell Nigerians in the coming days the real and remote cause of the mishap.
