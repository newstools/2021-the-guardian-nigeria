Lagos State Office of Civic Engagement, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, has asked all stakeholders to help eliminate cultism and drug abuse in the state through the recently signed Prohibition of Unlawful Societies and Cultism law. Special Adviser, Office of Civic Engagement, Princess Aderemi Adebowale, made the call during a three-day sensitisation on the effect of drug abuse and cultism among youths, held at Sanya Secondary School, Ijesha, State Senior High School, Ipaja and Oreyo Senior Secondary School, Igbogbo. She said the call became imperative to curb social menace of cultism and drug abuse among youths in the state. According to her, the new law, which approves a 21-year jail term for convicted cultists, underscores governmentâ€™s resolve to tackle cultism in the state. Adebowale lamented the predominance of cultism in higher institutions across the country, saying it had created awareness about its impacts on the society. Also, Felicia Odumosu said students who engage in drug abuse are at a very high risk of liver failure, low immunity system, mental health issues and also have low grades in their academics.
