Not less than 2,560 households in eight communities of Konshisha Local Council, Benue State, are benefiting from food and non-food items worth N89 million, courtesy of ActionAid Nigeria. The military had, in April this year, while searching for their missing weapons and colleagues, levelled some communities in the Konshisha, displacing many households. As part of the humanitarian intervention, ActionAid, yesterday, disbursed N14,500 each to the 2,560 households as palliative. The Manager, Humanitarian Residents, ActionaAid in Nigeria, David Habba, who represented the Country Director, Mrs. Christiana Obi, said that N89 million was earmarked by the organisation to provide food and non-food items for the victims at Gbinde, Gungul, Guleya, AWajir, Bonta, Agidi and Mbaakpur. According to the country director, this phase of intervention was mainly for food items, but in cash form; so that the beneficiaries would buy foodstuff of their choice, while the next round will involve the donation of other relief materials like clothes, footwears, buckets and dignity kits for women of reproductive age. The organisation promised to rehabilitate and construct water facilities in those areas, to address the water challenge occasioned by the destruction of water sources during the invasion. In addition, ActionAid Adviser on Logistics, Goodluck Omoh, said other items that would enable the victims to bounce back to life would be provided in the next round. The intervention will continue until all the profiled beneficiaries are reached, he added. Lauding the humanitarian gesture, District Head (Tyoor) of Iwarnyam ward, Chief Lazarus Koko, whose residence at Agidi community was also burnt during the attack, appreciated ActionaAid for giving them succour and blessed it to sustain the selfless service to humanity.
