As the world celebrates this year’s Children’s Day, a non-governmental organisation, Skool Media Nigeria limited, has assured of continuous intervention in digital learning to make Nigerian schools competitive and relevant in the 21st century. It stated that mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that Nigerian children continue to navigate post COVID-19 era without adversely affecting their educational pursuits. 
 
The group, in a statement by Head, Corporate Communications, Mr. Sola Oluwadare, urged examination bodies to make the process of registration for various examinations less tedious by applying simple technology strategies that will make it seamless for students.
 
For instance, as students go through the process of writing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), organised by Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB), Skool media is ready to partner with JAMB to put students on the right path.
 
He said: “We commend JAMB for the annual improvement in the deployment of technology for registration and conduct of UTME. We want to reiterate the need for JAMB to work with Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to make the exercise hassle-free. 
 
“As a matter of fact, a special window can be opened to warehouse yet to be linked SIMs on the portal to allow students register for exams, after which the window will be used to link NIN with SIM later. This should be worked out by the two bodies, followed by public enlightenment campaigns nationwide. Technology is not a zero-sum process that is devoid of alternative solutions,” Oluwadare added. He assured that the organisation is committed to addressing ICT skill gaps in line with emerging digital landscape of the 21st century in educational development. 
 
According to him, the Nigerian child must be prepared to take up the challenges of modern workplace by developing relevant technology skills capable of making them compete universally with their contemporaries. 
 
Oluwadare stated that there is no way students can cope with the next generation of tech giants without rich experience in the use of technological innovations to solve human problems.
 
He said the organisation would continue to collaborate with education stakeholders to bridge these gaps.
With its current infrastructure coupled with students’ technological experience, digital classrooms and computer based test centre, Oluwadare said Nigerian students are positioned to meet the demands of the 21st century.
 
“We have been demonstrating this by building the capacity of Nigerian educators, especially in secondary schools, to ensure a robust supply of highly-skilled students who are able to leverage enterprise opportunities that will make them employable later in life; thereby helping to shrink the unemployment gaps in Nigeria,” Oluwadare added.
