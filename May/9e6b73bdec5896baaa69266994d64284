Photo/Anadoluagency  The Renew Group Academy, which is based in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State and Antalya, Turkey, according to Obolo, aims to develop football from the grassroots and create an avenue for young players aspiring to be future football stars. He said the academy has over 20 players training in Nigeria and Turkey with reputable coaches and scouts monitoring them for placement at top clubs across Europe According to Obolo, apart from the partnership with PSG, the academy is also talking to Galatasaray of Turkey and Locomotive Moscow of Russia, among other international clubs. The football promoter, who doubles as the vice president of the Kickboxing Federation of Nigeria, revealed that the academy encourages talented kids in different sports to achieve their dreams, just as he called on the private sector to invest in the growth of the country’s sports. He said: “We need to realise that government cannot do everything. What is required is an enabling environment to encourage programmes such as the Renew Football Academy. Initiatives like this do not only encourage young talents but also keeps them healthy. “It is at the academy level that we can get the best trainers in sports. Sport is the biggest employer of labour, but we must do it right. It is cheaper to invest in local academies than to source ready-made talents abroad.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
