 Emmanuel Onwubiko  The group condemned the attack by gunmen in the early hours of Monday that led to the razing of Ubakala Police Station at Apumiri community, Ubakala in Umuahia South Local Council of Abia State. In a statement by the National Coordinator and National Media Affairs Director, Emmanuel Onwubiko and Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA cautioned the force against “roping in some unfortunate individuals caught in conflict with the law to admit being the persons responsible for spate of attacks.” It continued: “This is because if the police have actually arrested some of the unknown gunmen and extracted quality intelligence, then the spate of attacks by the same characters would have abated. We are by this media statement, cautioning the police not to use their old ways of rounding up certain suspects from wherever with the purpose of parading them hurriedly before the media as suspects in a given crime of high public notoriety just so the Commissioner of Police gets the accolades.” The group noted that the attacks targeting security institutions in the two zones were not the usual conventional crime, as “they are so complex and sophisticated in nature that the policing institution in partnership with the Department of State Services (DSS) and the intelligence department of the armed forces of Nigeria should synergse their strategies and adopt technology-driven, scientific and evidence-based forensic investigations to actually arrest the authentic crime suspects so as to put an end to the attacks.” HURIWA regretted the spike in violence amid claims by the Anambra, Rivers and Imo police commands that they had arrested the perpetrators.
