Tinubu Says APC leader has what it takes to rule Nigeria
A presidential election support group, South-West Agenda for Asiwaju (SWAGA), has said that the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, is the most competent Nigerian that has the capacity to fix the country and take it out of the woods. Chairman of SWAGA, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye and his deputy, Senator Rilwanu Soji Akanbi, while addressing the media, yesterday, said the position of president of Nigeria is too important to be awarded to anybody who did not really strive or prepare for it in the South. The group insisted that the position should be contested for among interested parties from the South in 2023 if the two major parties concede their tickets to the zone. Adeyeye said the position of Nigeria’s president could not just be awarded or micro zone to the South-East, which according to him, is only agitating that it is its turn to produce the next president of the country after the expiration of President Muhammadu Buhari tenure in 2023. He said: “We believe in the national leader’s capacity based on how he governed Lagos State. I also want to say that if the South refuses to start preparing and indicate strong interest from now, the Presidency may eventually not be zoned to the region. Adeyeye posited that what SWAGA is doing has no political party affiliation, adding: “We are not afraid if the ruling party throws its presidential ticket open. We have nothing against anybody, including the South-East and interested candidates from the North. Our position is that Tinubu for now is the best material for the job and he is also determined to see a better Nigeria.
