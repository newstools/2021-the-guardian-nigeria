According to the state secretary of MACBAN, Mr Adamu Abubakar, he was taken away on April 30 by some armed men dressed in military camouflage. Speaking on the issue on Tuesday, Abubakar said the abductors, numbering about eight, came in a white bus at about 12 noon to “forcefully” take away the chairman from his house at Chikara village, Kogi Local Government area. Abubakar said he was informed of the incident about an hour later by Damina’s younger brother, who claimed he witnessed the incident. He also stated that he immediately called the phone number of the missing chairman, but it rang out. Abubakar said Damina’s phone was switched off when he repeated the call about an hour later. “Since then, his lines are not reachable and all efforts to know his whereabout proved abortive,” Abubakar said. He said he immediately notified the state commissioner of police of the development, adding that the state government was also informed through the special adviser on security matters to the governor, Mr Jerry Omodara. He also said that a search party raised by MACBAN had visited other places, including abattoirs in and around Abuja to no avail. Meanwhile, the Kogi State Commissioner of Police Ede Ayuba, when contacted, said that the police are yet to locate the whereabouts of the Chairman. The Commissioner said that immediately he was informed of the incident, he called Damina’s phone severally but there was no response. Ayuba said efforts to get detailed information about the incident from the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area where the incident happened were unsuccessful as the matter have not been officially reported to him.
