  NASU further argued that the lies dubious political office holders sell to the uninformed public are that the government is spending a huge sum of its revenue on civil servants’ salaries and wages, whereas, salaries and wages of civil servants are not the sole components of the recurrent expenditure of the government. 
     
“Recurrent expenditure includes all payments other than for capital assets, including salaries and wages of civil servants, bogus salaries and allowances of political office holders, their travels both foreign and domestic, interest repayments on foreign and domestic loans, bogus subsidies and other overheads of government. If the government is sincerely interested in reducing the cost of governance, she should be bold and sincere enough to throw the searchlight at political office holders and members of the Legislative arm of government,” it said. 
   
NASU pleaded with President Buhari to have a rethink of the planned policy direction of his government at a time when for the same economic reasons, a country like the United States of America is considering raising her minimum pay to 15 dollars an hour, adding that to continue on this line of policy will only provoke Nigerian workers and incite them towards negative actions that may lead to unintended outcomes.
