The policy, named: National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector, was recently unveiled by the President, Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami.  “Generally, telecommunications equipment manufacturers and suppliers are classified into broad categories such as Consumer Premises Equipment (CPE) and Network Equipment category. The CPE segment is characterized by high volumes, less complexity, lower shelf-life and low maintenance. Conversely, the latter is characterised by low volumes (mainly Business2Business), higher complexity, higher shelf-life and higher maintenance. As such, this Policy prioritizes the manufacturing of CPEs,” the Policy stressed.
     
MEANWHILE, the objectives of the manufacturing focus area include the following: to stimulate the design, development, production, sales and utilization of high-quality telecoms equipment and services developed by indigenous companies; to develop indigenous telecommunication companies to become world-class manufacturers service providers; to incentivise the production of cables, connectors, masts and telecom tools in a way that meets global minimum and certification standards; to support local manufacturing through relevant institutions, such as the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), among others; to encourage the establishment of vocational training institutes focused on the design, fabrication and assembly of telecom equipment; and; to encourage partnerships and collaboration between global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) engaged in the manufacturing of telecommunications equipment and indigenous players.
