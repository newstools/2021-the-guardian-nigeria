A humanitarian source who spoke on condition of anonymity said: “The toll of six dead is a provisional one.” The source added that “angry inhabitants of the villages of Lume and Kinyatsi are asking themselves questions about the attackers’ identity, and have called on military authorities to identify which units operate in the zone.” A military spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Kinyatsi lies on a key road between Beni and Kasindi that supplies the area and is used to export agricultural produce. This week, 39 people have been killed on it despite the deployment of DR Congo and UN troops. On Friday, the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a monitoring organisation that has experts in the region, said at least 1,228 civilians have been killed in the Beni territory since November 2019 during attacks attributed to the ADF.
