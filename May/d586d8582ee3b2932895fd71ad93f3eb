The song is available on all digital streaming platforms and stores. Get it with the link below: https://snd.click/2mp4buni The record, an ode to Biafra Remembrance Day, highlights the twenty-pound economic injustice meted to the Igbos in 1979. Dedicating the song to his late grandfather who was a victim, Barzini says “The story of how we built back the generational wealth that was looted from us is not talked about enough. This is a thing of legend, any way you wanna look at it”. He enlists the creativity of Nollywood star/singer, NNAMDI AGBO, and veteran Nigerian Rapper DASUKI to produce an energy-packed hip hop anthem that tells an original African story. Barzini has been on a one song per month release spree this year after having blessed us with two incredible music projects in 2020: Beloved Vol. 1 and 2. The 28-yr old Nigerian rapper is passionate about mental health awareness and the proper documentation of African history and culture.
