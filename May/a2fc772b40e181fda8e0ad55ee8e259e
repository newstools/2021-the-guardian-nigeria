A rampaging group of notorious kidnappers terrorising inhabitants of Jos North local government area of Plateau State have kidnapped a proprietor of G-Medical Centre Jos and another nursing mother in the council area. The Guardian gathered from the scene of the incident  that the Proprietor of the Medical Centre, Bitrus Musa Agwon, was picked up in his house at Faraka area of the local government by kidnappers who stormed his residence at 7:00 pm on Tuesday. According to the source,” the proprietor who is also a Community  Health Officer was in his house when the kidnappers forced themselves in and kidnapped  him at a gunpoint, maltreated other members of the family before they  whisked him away to unknown  destination.” He continued,”Kidnapping is becoming  a daily occurrence in this part of the state capital. We had complained severely to the government and security agencies without any positive response. Up to the time I am talking to you the kidnappers have not contacted the family to know the whereabouts of the man.” The kidnappers  also invaded a nearby community of Eto-Baba in the same local government area and abducted a nursing mother simply identified as Paulina, leaving her baby behind. A member of the family, Gyang Ibrahim, the gunmen invaded the house at about 8:45 pm, threatening  to kill anyone who attempted to disrupt the operation, adding that the woman was forced into a waiting vehicle, leaving the baby crying. He added that before those in the house could raise the alarm, the hoodlums had disappeared. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Gabriel Ubah Ogaba, said his office was yet to be informed about the incidents. “ I am not aware of the incident,  let me get in touch with the DPO in charge of the area.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
