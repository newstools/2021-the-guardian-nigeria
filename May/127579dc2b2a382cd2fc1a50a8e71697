According to the presidential aide, the President, First Family, his personal aides, members of cabinet and Service Chiefs who choose to remain in Abuja will congregate in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa to observe the Eid prayers at 9 a.m. Shehu also announced that there would be no traditional Sallah homage to the President by religious, community and political leaders after the prayer. ”As was the case last year, the President encourages such leaders to be content with modest celebrations at home in view of the pandemic,” he said. The presidential aide also quoted the president as specially thanking the Ulama (Islamic Clerics) and all other religious (Muslim, Christian) leaders who had been praying for the wellbeing of the nation and its people. ”The President, in addition, takes this opportunity to condole with all who lost family members due to what he described as the ‘madness’ going on in parts of the country,” he added.
