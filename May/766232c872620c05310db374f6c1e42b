Every plant is unique and therefore has different requirements to grow and stay healthy. A quality pot would not only make your plant look its best, but it can also help keep them alive if you choose the right size pot with adequate drainage.
Plot Your Pot Consider where your pot would be located. Are you looking for a statement or hero piece? Something imposing with definite wow factor? Or perhaps it is more about functionality. For example, do you need slimline troughs to create privacy on a balcony?
Decide Your Personal Style Think about your personal style and the interior/exterior of your home. Is it contemporary and slick or traditional and formal? Look for a pot or planter to match. Above all, you need to choose a piece that you love, one that resonates with you.
Size Everything Up Your pot needs to be size-appropriate for your space, but be bold, in terms of scale. If in doubt, always go for the larger size.
The last thing you want to do in a confined space is to use lots of little pots, as this would just make the space look cluttered and even smaller. Go for either one big specimen or a simple group of three. Create An Interesting Composition
If you are buying a cluster of pots, it is important to mix the textures and sizes to create an interesting composition. Try three different sizes in three compatible textures. I recommend using pots in the same colour- personally, I love white- but in different textures. A slick and shiny fiberglass cylinder teamed with an old, lime-washed Turkish planter and a glazed Moroccan/Mediterranean oil jars, for example, would make a perfect combination. Be Careful With Colour
Avoid strong primary colours that can be jarring to the eye and draw too much attention to the pot. If you want some colour contrast, choose a soft shade, such as buttermilk, dark chocolate or white. Make An Investment
It is worth investing money in a hero piece for a prominent location. Use less expensive pots for more functional areas. In these spaces, you want to look at the plants inside the pots rather than the pots themselves. Play With Materials
I am in love with terracotta, the Abuja type made popular by Dr. Ladi Kwali of Bida. I think it is a classic, underrated material that needs to come back into our gardens. I especially love big, hand-thrown terracotta pots that would age gracefully in the sun. And rememberâ€¦ always buy the best available potting mix and ensure that the pot is raised off the ground for good drainage. Rather than using feet, use pieces of 10mm-thick compressed rubber to raise a pot, as this creates an interesting shadow line at the base.
