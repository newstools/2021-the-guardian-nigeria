In local councils visited such as Ido, Ibadan North and others, the materials and officials were not on ground as at 9.30 a.m. When The Guardian visited Ward 04, unit 04, which is a collation centre in Ido local council, a raft of security officers and scores of voters were seen but there was nobody to attend to them Aside from late arrival of men and materials, there was voter apathy in Ibadan North local council area. Most polling booths visited were empty. Along Iwo road at ward 11 polling unit 01 Abayomi Open Space, Abayomi Bus Stop, Iwo Road, Ibadan, Ibadan North East where Governor Seyi Makinde cast his vote, voting started at 10 am. After casting his vote, Governor Seyi Makinde lauded the OYSIEC for putting appropriate measures in place to aid the conduct of free and fair local council election in the 33 local council areas of the state. Makinde said he was delighted seeing people exercising their civic rights by voting for the candidates of their choice in a friendly and conducive atmosphere. “The security agencies are there and doing their work. From what they have told me, there is nothing overwhelming as they are on top of the situation. My message to the good people of Oyo State is, first, this is a process. We will throw up some people and it is not the end in itself but a means to an end. The end in democracy is good governance for Oyo State. The people must be eternally vigilant. Even though people are being elected today, we have to hold them accountable just like I am being accountable at the state level,” he added.
