Samu, represented by Mr Emmanuel Uneke, the command’s Assistant Public Relations Officer, said that the vehicle is a peach-coloured Toyota Camry car with registration number: Lagos: JJJ 45B. “The command’s surveillance team discovered the vehicle on the road which also leads to Ugwulangwu in Ohaozara LGA of the state. “The car is suspected to be stolen and I directed that it should be towed to the command’s headquarters in Abakaliki,” she said. The state commandant remarked that according to residents of the area, the vehicle was abandoned on the road since Jan 5. “We, therefore, urge people whose missing car bears such description to come with proof of ownership. “The vehicle has not been vandalised except its boot which surveillance team discovered was open,” she said.
