JAMB is billed to meet with stakeholders, including civil society groups and media ahead of the examination. One of such meetings is billed to hold for May 14, where the JAMB registrar, Ishaq Oloyede, is expected to address the stakeholders. A senior official told The Guardian under the condition of anonymity that the JAMB registrar might use the avenue to announce a new deadline. The decision to extend the deadline may not be unconnected with the glitches being experienced by prospective candidates in their attempts to generate the required codes towards setting up profiles using their National Identification Number (NIN). JAMB had set May 15 as the deadline for the registration, but only a little over one million candidates have so far registered for the UTME and about 30,000 candidates for the DE programme. This figure is low when compared to about 1.9 million UTME and 200,000 DE candidates captured last year. Investigation revealed that as of Wednesday, May 12, about 600,000 prospective candidates, who have initiated the registration process, are yet to receive the required codes to be sent to their mobile lines by the network operators. When contacted, JAMBâ€™s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Fabian Benjamin, refused to comment on the matter. The examination board had earlier scheduled its mock examination for April 30 but later rescheduled it to hold on May 20.
