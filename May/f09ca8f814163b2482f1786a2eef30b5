Ortom urged to enforce vigilante law The #IStandWithBuhari group has threatened to name the sponsors of violent campaigns to bring down President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and cause ethnic war. As a soft landing, the group gave the sponsors one month to desist from their activities or be exposed. At a press briefing in Abuja yesterday, spokesperson for the group, Ifeanyi Ogadimma, claimed to have some classified information on some of the plans by members of the opposition to further politicise the security situation in the country to score cheap political goals. Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State have been urged to enforce the law that provides for the Establishment of Community Volunteer Guards (Vigilante), enacted in the year 2000, to tackle insecurity in the state. In a communiqué issued after the expanded security stakeholders’ meeting at the Government House, Makurdi, yesterday, it was resolved that the renewed attacks on the people by armed herdsmen had overstretched conventional Security agencies in the state; hence the need to strengthen the vigilance group. Consequently, the governor directed the massive recruitment into the vigilance groups in the 23 local councils of the state. He was mandated to support the Vigilante with logistics as provided in the law. The stakeholders also lauded the commitment of Benue people to the enforcement of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017. “The meeting emphasised the need for all stakeholders to join hands in tackling insecurity in Benue, devoid of political, religious and ethnic sentiments. It unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the governor for securing the state.” Leaders of the three main socio-cultural organisations in Benue, including Mzough-U-Tiv, Ochetoha K’Idoma and Omini Igede, moved the motion for the vote of confidence.
