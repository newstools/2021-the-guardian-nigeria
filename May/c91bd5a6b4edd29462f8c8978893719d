A farmer, Mr Uche Ikenga,  says irregular rainfall pattern being currently recorded may have adverse effects on food production in the country. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos, Ikenga said the irregular rainfall might also soon affect prices of food stuffs. “The inconsistencies in rainfall pattern this year has grossly affected cultivation of crops and food production in general. “Most local crop farmers are currently depending on irrigation to grow their crops. “Even with constant watering of  farms, the ground  will soon parch because of the velocity of heat from the sun. “This inconsistent rainfall pattern is a big problem for us because we keep watering but we are not getting the needed impact,” he said. Ikenga also said that the cost of crop production had increased, noting that farmers spent more to keep their farms irrigated because of irregular rainfall. “This expenses will likely reflect on food prices in the coming year if farmers continue to spend more to keep their farms irrigated. “We hope the rain begins in earnest so that the situation will not deteriorate to food scarcity in the nearest future. ” Many farmers have abandoned  their farms for now. ” Yam and potato farmers have not commenced cultivation  because these crops depend mainly on constant rainfall. “Climate change is really affecting  crop production this year,” Ikenga said. He called  on governments to assist farmers with irrigation facilities to achieve food security. “One way the government can help us is in the provision of irrigation system where we have farming clusters. “The government can sink boreholes for local farmers to help us at a time like this. ” We need this intervention to boost food production,” he said.
