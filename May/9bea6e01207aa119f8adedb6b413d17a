The Delta State Government, yesterday, expressed its readiness to partner with the Nigerian Army to secure the nation’s territorial integrity.
Governor Ifeanyi Okowa gave the assurance in Asaba when about 53 students of the Army College of Logistics in Lagos State, visited him and assured of their readiness to partner with the state government for better protection of the country. The students were on a study tour with the theme: Strengthening Logistics Support For Military Operations Through Synergy Between The Civil And Military Sectors Of The Nigerian Society. Okowa, who spoke through the Secretary to State Government (SSG), Chiedu Ebie, said the state would do its best for the movement of the Army since logistics entails movement of personnel, materials and deployment and procurement. “Because it is an important component of any organisation, big companies have gone under because their procurement processes were wrong,” stressing that the state government has engaged communities leaders and security personnel aimed at arresting youth restiveness across the state. He disclosed that the state government has also focused attention on youth entrepreneurship programme and technical education, adding that three existing higher institutions have been upgraded to university status and have been approved by the National Universities Commission (NUC), with the hope that the institutions would commence academic activities in September this year. Speaking, Commandant of the Nigerian Navy, Maj.-Gen. M. O. Enendu, disclosed that the purpose of the visit was to familiarise themselves with the environment where the students would operate.
