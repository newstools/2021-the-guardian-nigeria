Ebubeagu Security Outfit, Ebonyi State Chapter, and the police have arrested 37 Unknown Gunmen (UGM) planning to attack police stations, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) offices and courts. The Guardian gathered that the suspects were arrested at Agubia axis in Ikwo Local Council of the state during their pre-attack meeting. Confirming the arrest, the Commissioner for Internal Security, Border Peace and Conflict Resolutions, Chief Stanley Emegha, said the 37 suspects were arrested during a joint operation coordinated by Ebubeagu and the Ikwo Local Council Chairman, Steve Orogwu, in conjunction with the Ikwo Divisional Police Officer (DPO). Emegha said the suspects were arrested following a tip-off that they were about to attack a police station in the area, raze some INEC offices and courts in the area. The commissioner noted that the suspects came from different parts of the South East. “We got information that there were people gathering to go and burn police stations, INEC offices and court in the area and then the Ebubeagu quickly mobilised and swooped on them.” “It was discovered that they have a map and came from different places like Enugu, Imo and others from different local councils of Ebonyi. We asked questions and they said they have the authority of whomever they called their boss that I don’t know to burn those places. Unfortunately, luck ran out of them and they were all arrested and have been handed over to the police,” he added.
