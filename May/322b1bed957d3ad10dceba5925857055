From Anthony Otaru, Abuja
DESPITE negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, the Bank of Industry (BOI) showed resilience in the 2020 financial period as it grew total assets to N1.86 trillion in the 2020 financial year. The N1.86trn represents an increase of 79.1 per cent when compared to the N1.04 trillion the bank recorded in 2019. The Chairman of the bank, Aliyu Abdulrahman Dikko, gave the figures at the 61st yearly general meeting. Dikko said: “2020 will go down in history as a year to remember. Following the initial discovery of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the virus rapidly spread to almost every country across the globe, leaving unprecedented health and economic crises”. He explained that most economies experienced recessionary pressures in the year as business transactions nosedived. Despite the negative impact, he said, the bank’s financial statements remain strong and resilient. For instance, he noted, the increase in total assets was driven, to a large extent, by the successful debt syndications of €1bn and $1bn that was concluded in March and December 2020 respectively. He stressed that the bank’s total equity increased by 15.3 per cent from N293.08 billion in the previous year to N336.48 billion in 2020. He told the shareholders that loans and advances grew marginally by 1.3 per cent to N749.84 billion. According to him, the profit before tax (PBT) fell by 9.6 per cent from N39.34 billion in 2019 to N35.54 billion. Dikko said the bank facilitated the disbursement of N2.5 billion and N1.2 billion under the N-Power and Government Enterprise and Empowerment.
