The Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) has set aside N4.5 million for this year’s national championships scheduled to hold between May 18 and 22 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Participants in the junior, U-21, men, women and veteran divisions will contest in the five-day 12 events championship, where winners in the men and women singles events will receive N250, 000 each. The under-21 class will get N100, 000, N50, 000 is set aside for the winners in the cadet championship, N200, 000 will be won in the team event, while winners of the doubles events will get N100, 000. Quarterfinalists are guaranteed N50, 000 each. According to the organisers, this year’s championships will hand the national coaches opportunity to scout for talents for the cadet and senior national teams. Top seed, Fatimo Bello, who won the singles title, both at the National Sports Festival in 2018 Abuja and Edo 2020, has vowed to resume her dominance at the national level. “I will come to Lagos to give my very best again because I must remain on top of my game as there are no pushovers in the game again. Everybody wants to become champion, but it is a bit tougher to remain on top,” said Bello, who won the singles events at the just concluded Aso Championship. Championships’ umpire, Mr. John Peters, foresees a robust battle ahead of the national tournament in Lagos. “I must tell you that new players are emerging, especially at junior level, as players from Kwara and Ogun are on top of their game and are ready to dethrone reigning champions. “I am hopeful that it will be explosive in Lagos as more players have confirmed their intention to be part of the show,” he stated.
