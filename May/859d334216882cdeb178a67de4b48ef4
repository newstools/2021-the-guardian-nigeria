Football fans at the Hustle and Bustle Viewing Centre to watch the Manchester City versus Chelsea UEFA Champions League final, which ended 1-0 in favour of Chelsea at the weekend, have described the large screen provided for the event by Heineken as ideal for viewing such big games outdoor. In anticipation of an exciting end to the 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League season, the brand unveiled a new campaign tagged, “You’re Never Watching Alone: Share the Passion.” Fans at the centre described the event as the most glamorous and most followed football competition they have ever witnessed in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs. “My greatest joy is the large screen that made it look as if one is in the main stadium watching the live game. Should Heineken continue providing this type of facility to enable football fans to watch both English Premier League and our local league matches, I believe it would reduce the tension caused by the incessant banditry and other social vices in this area,” Jalla Isa, one of the fans told The Guardian. A lady fan spotted at the centre, Ruth Amadu, said the large screen made the players real. “It was exciting watching from such a large screen and it cannot be compared with the toy-like television screen in the house. “Also, the moment you stepped into the venue, one feels safe with the type of security in place,” she added. Speaking on the campaign before the game, Senior Brand Manager, Heineken, Aishat Anaekwe, said: “This promises to be yet another exciting UCL final for football fans and consumers. As such, we had to devise ways to complement the spectacle and enhance the experience for Nigerian football fans with a host of exciting activities through which they can share and channel that passion that comes with every topical moment in the competition.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
