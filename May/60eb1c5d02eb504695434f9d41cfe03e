He renewed the charge  angrily denounced by Israel that the Jewish state is pursuing a policy of “apartheid” against the Palestinians. “Act now to end the aggression. Act now so freedom can prevail not apartheid,” he told the Security Council. Maliki part of the Palestinian Authority, not the Hamas militant group which has been firing rockets into the Jewish state  voiced regret over Israeli deaths but urged the Security Council to examine the power balance. Israel “is an occupying colonial power. Any assessment of the situation that fails to take into account this fundamental fact is biased,” Maliki said. “Israel always says, put yourselves in our shoes. But Israel is not wearing shoes. It is wearing military boots.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
