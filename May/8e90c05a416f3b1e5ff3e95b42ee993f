The Kano State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Abdullahi Haruna, said this in a statement on Saturday in Kano. Haruna said that the policeman attached to the command’s Motor Traffic Division (MTD) recovered the money while conducting analysis at an accident scene on the Kano-Zaria road. He said that an articulated vehicle had knocked down a motorcycle rider, who died on the spot, adding that the victim was in possession of the money packed in a box. “The police officer returned N1,294,200 found at the scene of the fatal accident,” he said. Haruna said that the Commissioner of Police, Mr Sama’ila Dikko, handed over the money to the relatives of the deceased and called on police personnel and residents of the state to emulate Isah’s good deed. According to him, the Managing Director, Kano Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA), Mr Baffa Dan-Agundi, gifted Isah with N100,000 as reward for his honesty and dedication to duty. Haruna said that the command, in a related activity, distributed food items to widows of 26 police personnel who lost their lives in service.
