Rapper Lil Wayne Among Many Others To Be Pardoned By Donald Trump Donald Trump is today set to issue more than 100 pardons and commutations on his final day in office in a report by the Mirror. It will be one of his final acts before he leaves Washington DC at 8 am tomorrow, becoming the first living ex-President not to attend his successor’s inauguration since 1869. Rapper Lil Wayne, who faces up to 10 years in prison after admitting gun charges, is in line for a pardon according to reports. Thousands of troops are guarding the US Capitol amid fears of fresh rioting as Trump leaves office. Inauguration rehearsals were evacuated and the Capitol, which was stormed by a Trump-supporting mob on January 6, was put on lockdown after a small explosion and a fire in a nearby homeless camp, Capitol Police said. Also, the Tiger King star, 57, real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage, who is serving 22 years behind bars for his role in a murder-for-hire plot to kill his nemesis Carole Baskin and violating wildlife laws is also pleading for a pardon from Donald Trump. Joe Exotic‘s team are so convinced he’s going to get a pardon from Donald Trump, they have already booked a limo booked to collect him from prison with a hairdresser and make-up artist on standby. Pardons are often handed out at the very end of a president’s term, but with Trump’s time in office set to come to an end tomorrow, there’s still no sign of whether he’ll pardon Joe. Legal experts noted that a pardon does not overturn a conviction, it rather exempts the person of punishment, such as jail time or monetary fines, under that conviction. Although most pardons are issued to people who have already been sentenced in court, they can also be pre-emptive, covering conduct that has not yet been prosecuted or led to a guilty verdict, but they cannot apply to crimes committed in the future.
