The former Imo chief executive had recently honoured an invitation of Governor Nyeson Wike to commission some projects initiated and completed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in Rivers State. Besides, the senator had equally hinted of a political movement during a live programme. But addressing some party officials, including the State Working Committee (SWC) at the weekend in Owerri, Okorocha clarified that he remained a member of the APC. He clarified: “Our party is APC. Don’t be confused when I said that there were bad people and good people in both APC and PDP. And that the good people in the two parties should come together for the good of the nation. I was only talking about a movement and not party. “I have not left APC. I am still in APC. Nobody has (better) stake in APC than me. The worst insult I had in Imo and in the South East in 2015 was because of APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. APC was formed by President Buhari, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, myself and a few other people. But those on congratulations trip have taken over the party.” The chairman of Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism observed that Buhari was unaware of the “crisis of injustice ravaging the party in the state”, insisting that Daniel Nwafor remained chairman of the party in Imo “based on the decision of the Appeal Court, which is yet to be vacated.” He maintained: “Daniel Nwafor and others, duly elected as executives of the party, remain as such. Those who want to destroy the party lied to President Buhari. The judgments on the issue all stated that the NEC of the party or the governor cannot remove the party excos. The party executives can only be removed by convention.” Okorocha continued: “Whatever they do here without the duly elected party officials in the state, including the planned registration exercise, expected to begin on Monday (today), would be null and void. We do not recognise Governor Uzodinma’s APC in Imo. That’s not APC in Imo State. That’s PDP People. How many APC members are among his more than 120 appointees? None of course! “We had a formidable APC until those who came through Ben Johnson way with the help of their likes, came to hijack the party. Now, they cannot fly because nature does not support injustice. President Muhammadu Buhari, as a man of Justice, does not support injustice.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
