Work had ceased since March last year following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, which compelled contractors to leave the site. During a visit to the Stadium, yesterday, it was observed that the playing surface had been completely compacted, while contractors were working on drainages and sand fillers. Backhoe excavators and other heavy machinery were seen working so as to meet the deadline. On hand to see the progress of work was the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Monday Uko, who explained that the governor is committed to the timely completion of all on-going projects in the lifespan of his administration in line with his Completion Agenda. He said: “We are embarking on a twin project because work has also resumed at Eket Township Stadium, whose reconstruction was almost completed before the outbreak of Covid-19. This Stadium is a historic facility, which is very dear to Akwa Ibom people, and we are committed to giving it the facelift it deserves. We will transform it into a 21st-century-compliant structure. “All the equipment required for the execution of this project are on the ground, and we are confident of completing it as soon as possible,” Uko added. When completed, the remodelled Uyo Township Stadium will not only be home to Akwa Ibom’s second astroturf facility but will also ease the pressure on the usage of the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium.
