As group alerts to resurgence of pipelines vandalism in N’Delta The Nigerian Navy, yesterday, cautioned those planning renewed hostilities in the Niger Delta region to desist or face decisive action from the Navy and military. Field Officer Commanding (FOC), Central Naval Command (CNC), Real Admiral Saidu Garba, stated this in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, while fielding questions from journalists after the commissioning of housing projects at the Command. He stressed that the military would deal decisively with anyone who undermines oil facilities and threatens Nigeria’s unity. The Guardian recalled that the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) last week threatened to renew hostilities on oil installations over infrastructure deficit in the Niger Delta and Federal Government’s lackadaisical attitude towards a quick solution. Garba, who represented the Special Guest of Honour and Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas, said the Nigeria Navy and other military formations were ready to deal with economic saboteurs. “The Nigeria Navy in collaboration with the Nigeria military will deal with any one who undermines the country’s unity. Specifically, destruction of oil and gas infrastructure is an economic sabotage. “We advise anyone with such intentions should address their grievances with government and discuss a means of tackling the issues,” he said. MEANWHILE, the Conduct and Due Process Group has raised the alarm over possible resurgence of pipelines vandalism in the Niger Delta region.
In a statement issued by its representative, Comrade Adediran Raymon, the group claimed that the ongoing conflict between the owners of two pipeline security surveillance firms was the basis for its apprehension. Urging the authorities to intervene in the conflict in the interest of the country, the group promised to explore avenues to broker peace between the contending parties. “Our organisation has been watching the conflict between the founders and directors of Ocean Marine Solutions Limited. While this might seem like a mere internal conflict, it poses greater threat to the stability of the oil producing areas, national oil infrastructure and the nation’s oil revenue. “The Federal Government paid Ocean Marine Solutions Limited, formerly known as Ocean Marine Security Limited to provide surveillance and security services for its oil facilities. “This kind of conflict could be devastating for the nation’s economy if the authorities do not step in immediately because of the caliber of the persons involved: Dr. Tunde Ayeni and Captain Idahosa Okunbo,” the statement reads. The group expressed concern that if the company was destabilised, the pipelines they were meant to protect would be vulnerable to vandalism and previous security arrangements would be nullified.
