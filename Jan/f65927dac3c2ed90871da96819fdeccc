It said: “The APC’s inaction in the face of the dismissive declaration by the Buhari Presidency that Nigerians, who they had promised restructuring, should now channel their demands to the National Assembly, only goes to further validate assertions among Nigerians that APC is a deceptive power-grabbing platform, which is not interested in governance or fulfilling its promises to Nigerians.” The PDP described as “very disappointing that almost six years after riding to power on the promise of restructuring, the Buhari Presidency has made no concrete effort towards forwarding an executive bill to the National Assembly on the matter, only to now ask Nigerians to carry their burden to the legislative houses.” The party asserted that besides President Buhari, “other bigger culprits of the failure on restructuring are the silent APC leaders, who, despite promising restructuring, are clandestinely supportive of its huge betrayal.” It urged APC to take responsibility for on-going challenges to national unity, having failed to fulfill promises it made on restructurings, such as devolution of power and true federalism. “We are already aware of plots by certain APC leaders to recourse to condemning President Buhari as being singularly responsible for the failures of his administration and use such a narrative to beguile Nigerians again with another round of fake promises on restructuring,” the statement added.
