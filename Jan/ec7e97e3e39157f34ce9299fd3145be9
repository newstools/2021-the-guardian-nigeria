 Apex and Bionic  After the JFK Resolute Music duo revealed art cover to their most anticipated project in 2020, designed by a fan who won a whopping amount of money for his creative contribution after weeks of entries from fans, there was outrage as to the connotation of the art. Some felt the selected image had an evil undertone when the artistes revealed the cover on their social media platforms. An Instagram user by the name of @SsanuAdebayo said, “Demonic song, a lot of people are just listening to songs anyhow, this is an album they dedicated to the devil. Take a look at the shadow behind their image and tell me what you see.” Another user (@kadirimanfred said, “And how many of us are seeing that from the album cover, the shadow of the artiste is satanic and we are praying to God to favour their effort when portraying demonic.” Another user @ihuwovictorchinedu said, “Can someone explain the shadow behind these two guys, most music belongs to the devil and his agents.” On and on, the comments trickled in to bedevil the duo. After days of continuous online bashing the duo had to address the speculations. “The album cover doesn’t in any way represent something diabolic rather it is an expression of art that is open to different interpretations, hence why it has caused such a stir online. However, it ideally reflects the two-timing faces of the people around us.
AB dropped their most recent body of work on September 4, 2020 titled Nobody Holy, which featured Davido, 2baba, Seyi Shay, Oritsefemi and Slimcase.”
