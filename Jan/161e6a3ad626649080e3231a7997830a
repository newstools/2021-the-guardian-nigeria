Louis Carter Onwugbenu Scholarship Foundation has produced three first-class graduates from among the over 350 beneficiaries in the last years of its existence. Chairperson of the Board of Trustees overseeing the Foundation, Lady Josephine Nwangwu, who disclosed this at the yearly celebration service held yesterday at Uruagu Nnewi, Anambra State, added that the Board in August every year goes into strict screening process to get new qualified bright indigent beneficiaries. The programme, which covers secondary and university education, according to her, remains open to all Nigerian citizens, listing dedication, commitment and discipline as key in their considerations; hence none of the beneficiaries had ever fallen out of favour with the guidelines. The benefactor, Chief Louis Carter Onwugbenu, an Nnewi-based businessman, said he derives satisfaction whenever his investment in human capital development yields very positive results. He, therefore, urged beneficiaries to remain good ambassadors of the Foundation, charging them to replicate his effort, so as to multiply the blessing. While presenting bags of rice to them, Onwugbenu reiterated his zero tolerance for cultism and any other anti-social vices. His son Emeka Onwugbenu, expressed joy that the Foundation has now blossomed into something big, urging beneficiaries to stand firm to compete favourably with beneficiaries of the United States-based Carnegie Mellon Foundation, after which the Louis Carter Foundation was modelled. A member of the BoT, Rev Fr. Charles Ideke, prayed that all the beneficiaries become materials of pride and happiness to Onwugbenu, the Foundation and all citizens.
