China is sanctioning more than two dozen officials and members of former President Donald Trump's cabinet, including his secretary of state Mike Pompeo, for violating the country's "sovereignty", its foreign ministry said Wednesday. "China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China's sovereignty," the foreign ministry said in a statement as Trump's successor President Joe Biden was inaugurated in Washington. Beyond Pompeo, those sanctioned include Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro, national security advisor Robert O'Brien, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs David Stilwell, health secretary Alex Azar and UN envoy Kelly Craft. Beijing also sanctioned former Trump national security advisor John Bolton and former advisor Stephen Bannon. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
