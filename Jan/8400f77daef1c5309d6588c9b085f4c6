Immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, yesterday, recounted how former President Olusegun Obasanjo almost retired him 21 years ago as a major. Speaking while handing over to his successor, Major General Ibrahim Attahiru in Abuja, the ex-COAS said his retirement after 40 years of service was historic. Thanking troops serving at home and abroad, Buratai noted that the military would not remain the same owing to his transformational leadership and achievements.  His words: “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo almost retired me 21 years ago when I was a major. My retirement after 40 years of service is historic, hence it calls for gratitude.” He added that the Nigerian Army had been better positioned with intelligence gathering techniques and equipment. Buratai insisted that the security situation in country was largely stabilised under his watch. He said his administration would be remembered for three things – improved professionalism, improved responsiveness to personnel welfare and responsiveness to Nigeria’s democratic system. Responding, General Attahiru lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for finding him worthy to lead. He then sought support of soldiers and officers to build a Nigerian Army of their dream. There was jubilation across military units and formations as the new COAS took over.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
