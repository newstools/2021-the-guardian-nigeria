Plans are underway by the National Productivity Centre (NPC) to develop specific programmes aimed at boosting the productivity of women in their various endeavours. The Director-General of the Centre, Dr Kashim Akor, who stated this in Lokoja, Kogi State, at the decoration of Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi State as an ambassador by the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), explained that conversations that equip individuals and build the capacity of organizations with the requisite knowledge, tools and techniques for working smart and continuous improvement are of utmost interest to the NPC.  “This is 10% above the Beijing conference requirement of 35%. There is a total of 103 women in government in all the Local Government Councils of Kogi State. Never has this occurred in the history of the State and in Nigeria. This is indeed a great feat worth celebrating. We are therefore proud of the governor’s achievements especially providing women with the opportunity to contribute their quota as mothers and leaders to the political and socio-economic development of the State,” he said.
 
Akor submitted that bestowing the award of the ‘Most gender-sensitive governor in Nigeria’ on the governor is a call to offer more quality service, saying, “I want to congratulate our dear Governor for the award and to quickly remind him that to whom much is given, much is expected. The National Productivity Centre as a knowledge-based institution will continue to assist in building your capacities. As an Ambassador, our women look up to you to further advance the cause of the Nigerian woman.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
