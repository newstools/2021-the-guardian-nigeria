The National Examination Council (NECO) has released the 2020 Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) results. The results announced by the Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of NECO, Prof. Godswill Obioma, at its national headquarters in Niger State, show that 894,101 candidates, representing 73.89 per cent, scored five credits and above with both English and Mathematics. In English language alone, 973,331 candidates, representing 82.68 per cent, made credit and higher grades. The results further reveal that the number of candidates who made five credits and above, irrespective of English language and Mathematics, is 1,112,041, representing 91.91 per cent. This, according to Obioma, represents an increase of 2.01 per cent when compared to the 2019 June/July SSCE. The NECO boss disclosed that 1,221,447 candidates registered for the examination, with 659,796 being males (54.53 per cent), and 550,126 (45.46 per cent) being females. The NECO SSCE was, however, disrupted in some states by COVID-19 pandemic and the #EndSARS protests in many states, including Abia, Enugu, Edo, River, Ondo, Ekiti, Lagos, Oyo, Kano and Ogun as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Obioma listed the affected subjects as Chemistry practical, Economics, Technological Drawing, Food and Nutrition, and Further Mathematics. According to him, results of the affected candidates will be pending until supplementary exams are conducted for the papers missed.
