After our isolation is completed, I will follow US Soccer’s return to play guidelines to ensure my body is fully recovered and I can join my teammates back on the field soon.” Morgan is married to former Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Servando Carrasco, and the couple has a seven-month-old daughter, Charlie. The family returned to California from London, where Morgan had appeared in five matches for Tottenham in the Women’s Super League before announcing her intention to return to the United States to play in 2021. She had been expected to report to the US women’s training camp later in January. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
