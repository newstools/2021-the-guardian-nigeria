Ayodele Subair. Executive chairman, LIRS The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has urged all the employers in Lagos State to file their yearly tax returns on or before the statutory deadline of January 31, 2021 to avoid penalties in line with the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) Cap P8 LFN 2011 (as amended). In a statement yesterday, signed by its Head, Corporate Communications, Monsurat Amasa, the agency said that the e-tax platform launched in October 2019 gives tax-payers the opportunity to comply with all COVID-19 protocols by filing their tax returns from the comfort of their offices or homes. It added that all digital platforms and tax portals were available for tax-payers’ use and convenience. Executive Chairman of LIRS, Mr. Ayodele Subair, said that in the face of the prevailing realities of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on businesses, penalties and fines might be an additional burden on companies’ finances, and therefore urged all employers of labour to file their returns within the period stipulated by law. He said: “The essence of the ongoing media campaign and numerous reminders and appeals to companies on this statutory obligation is to ensure they file early to avoid sanctions. The steps to file are available on all our communication channels; however, tax-payers with difficulties filing are also to seek assistance with specially-designated officials at our tax stations. “We have made the process simple, quick, secure and reliable for our esteemed tax-payers. We are also available on various digital platforms to assist tax-payers in the process of e-filing. The LIRS urges all Lagos State residents and businesses to stay safe and obey all COVID-19 guidelines as stipulated by the relevant health authorities and the Lagos State government.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
