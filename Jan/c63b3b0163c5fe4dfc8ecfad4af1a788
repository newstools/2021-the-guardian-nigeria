T 10 days after it was released, Netflix projected that the series would be watched by 63 million households within 28 days of its debut, which would have made it the fifth most-watched Netflix original series launch of all time. However, the series exceeded that projection with an impressive 19 million. Bridgerton is now part of a collection of explosively popular Netflix series that were released in the last year while the entertainment history struggled during the coronavirus pandemic. That list includes chess drama The Queen’s Gambit and French thriller Lupin, both of which were watched by more than 62 million and 70 million households, respectively. “I do think that I am seeing a pivot in terms of people wanting things to feel a little more aspirational and just escapist and feel good. It’s hard to know where we’ll be a couple years from now, but I think that this is going to be the trend for a while. I imagine it’s going to continue to go this blue sky, feel-good route,” Netflix’s head of drama development said. On January 21, 2021, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.
