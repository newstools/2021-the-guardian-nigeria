The nine-month old strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), to us parents, is born out of government’s inability to get enough funds to fulfill her promise to pay ASUU their emoluments and development demands. Certainly, ASUU demands are legitimate; they are behaving in tandem with their counterparts the world over. Government should meet their demands. Government should stop suffering the Nigerian people through poor allocation of resources. We don’t know how much is being wasted on sustaining the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). But if you scrap NYSC and add its allocation to education in order to satisfy ASUU, it will raise education to the minimum 26 percent of the budget recommended by the United Nations. We do know that Nigeria was more united before 1973 when NYSC started than now. It is justice and equity that will unite Nigeria, not NYSC.   Yakubu Gowon established NYSC when he didn’t know what to do with petrol dollars rolling in.
   
Moreover, there are many other needs battling for Federal Government’s attention. With the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, government has to cut costs to thrive. And Nigeria has assets wasting away all over the country. Government should leverage on these assets to boost its revenue to enable her fulfil financial obligations. The idle assets exist in real estate and agriculture; are worth $900 billion according to an estimate by the U.S consulting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers. Economists say privatising these assets, which daily lose their real value through wear and tear- will generate worthwhile capital for the government.  In any case, data from the Budget Office of the Federation showed that Nigeria recorded no privatization proceeds in the first half of 2020, a deviation from the N63.02 billion it promised to generate from privatization proceeds. On the whole, ignorance and lack of will from our policymakers is responsible for Nigeria’s decline and her experience of two recessions in five years.
