Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value appreciated by N325 billion to close at N21.419 trillion. The uptrend was driven by price appreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks such as Seplat Petroleum Development Company (SEPLAT), Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria Communications, Ardova Plc and NASCON Allied Industries. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “Following four consecutive sessions of closing in the green, we expect the market to close the week on a bullish note, as the domestic bourse continues to move higher amidst dominance of the bulls. However, with the index now trading in the overbought region, the possibility of profit-taking cannot be overruled.” Market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive as 49 stocks gained, relative to seven losers.
