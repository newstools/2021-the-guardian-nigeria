Issuing the warning after taking over from Sule Maku, who was transferred to Special Protection Unit (SPU), Force Headquarters (FHQ), Abuja, Garba noted that he was assuming duty to tackle insecurity in the state. He assured officers and men, media practitioners and other stakeholders that their maximum cooperation would win the battle against all forms of crimes in the country. Efforts would be put in place to ensure that robbery, kidnapping, cultism and other social vices were curtailed to barest level in the state, he promised. “It is obvious that security challenge is a serious problem in Nigeria today, and Ebonyi State is not an exception. “I intend to put in place: respect to fundamental human rights of the citizens as enshrined in the constitution and professionalism by my officers and men while discharging their constitutional mandate to protect lives and properties in the state; robust collaboration with sister agencies to tackle all sorts of criminalities in the state; identification of crime-prone areas and boundary/community clashes to dialogue in town hall meetings.” “All efforts will be put in place to ensure that we fight against all sorts of heinous crimes like robbery, kidnapping, cultism and other social vices with a view to minimise the menace to the barest level in the state,” he said. Garba, who hails from Kontagora Council of Niger State, is the 24th CP of Ebonyi State Command since the creation of the state in 1996.
