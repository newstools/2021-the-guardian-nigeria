Gunmen have killed former Education Secretary in Nasarawa Council, Salihu Ibrahim, and abducted 20 passengers along Buga/Gwari/Gadabuke/Toto road in Toto Council of Nasarawa State. The incident, The Guardian gathered, took place on Monday afternoon. According to a witness, the former education secretary was travelling to Toto from Nasarawa when he was shot dead.

We sent our men to the scene and they recovered a Rover salon car with registration number NTT 265AA. Two mobile phones were discovered inside the vehicle, but the whereabouts of the occupants were not known. “Somebody, however, recognised the vehicle that it belonged to his brother who left Nasarawa for Gadabuke yesterday. So the vehicle was kept at the station.” Nansel also said that the Commissioner of Police directed the Divisional Police Oficer (DPO) of Toto to mobilise his men to start combing the bushes.
