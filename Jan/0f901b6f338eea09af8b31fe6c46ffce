•Claim Insecurity Crippling Conducive Learning Environment 
With the rising wave of insecurity, leading to the vandalisation of school facilities, members of the Lagos State School-Based Management Committee (SBMC), want the state government to beef up security in schools.
 
They made the call at a training session for about120 SBMC members by Human Development Initiatives (HDI) on complementing government efforts in providing quality basic education in Lagos. 
 
They stated that as a result of lack of fence, break down of fence, no school gate and security guards, touts and hoodlums often had easy entry into schools and classroom to carry out nefarious activities, including vandalising and stealing school property.  The Executive Director, HDI, Mrs. Olufunso Owasanoye, said the training was to empower SBMC members on ways to mobilise resources to help meet some of the challenges in their schools, as well as better engage with other stakeholders within the education sector. 
 
She said because government alone cannot address all educational gaps, SBMC members need to rise up, strategise to ensure community schools’ needs are met.
 
She added that resource mobilisation is one of the major functions of SBMC, but in disbursing the fund, they must priotise schools and pupils’ needs. 
 
Also, HDI’s Programme Officer, Johnson Ibidapo, said it is important that government efforts at providing quality basic education is complemented through Private Partnership Programme, and SBMC members could help in that direction.
