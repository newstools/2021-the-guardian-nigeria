My suspension illegal, says chair
The crisis rocking Oyo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has deepened as its chairman in Ibadan North East Local Council, Mr. Taiwo Iyiola, was yesterday suspended for alleged anti-party activities. In a communique by the State Working Committee, which was made available to journalists in Ibadan, the party said Iyiola was suspended over alleged anti-party activities by the executives of his ward. The state chapter of the party also directed the vice chairman, Mr. Isiaka Fatokun, to immediately take over the leadership pending conclusion of investigations. BUT Iyiola, in his reaction, described his suspension as illegal, saying that he got the news of his suspension on a Facebook page. Iyiola said he was surprised when he saw the news, adding that he had never been found wanting and the party does not have any evidence of anti-party activities levelled against him. He said: “I’ve never for once engaged in any anti-party activity since I have been in this party, and I have never been served any query. So, I don’t know what my offence was that warranted my suspension.” “This is the local council of Governor Seyi Makinde and the governor himself knows that I am doing my duty as expected. I am sure that the governor is not aware of the purported suspension. “This issue can destroy the party because why will the party suspend an innocent person? It shows that anybody can be tormented and frustrated out of the party.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
