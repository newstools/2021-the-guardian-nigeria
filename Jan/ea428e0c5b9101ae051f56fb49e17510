The Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Abuja has finally granted bail to the convener of #RevolutionNow and publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore. Sowore was granted bail alongside four others standing trial for alleged unlawful assembly, criminal conspiracy and inciting public disturbance. The defendants had been remanded in Kuje Correctional Centre, following their arraignment by the Federal Government. Ruling on the bail application, which was filed on behalf of the defendants by their counsel, Chief Magistrate Mabel Segun-Bello admitted Sowore to bail in the sum of N20 million and two sureties in the like sum. The court also ordered Sowore to remain in Abuja and physically report to the registrar every Monday and Friday, pending the hearing and determination of the charges against him. One of his sureties must be a civil servant not below Grade Level 12. The other defendants were also granted bail in the sum of N1 million each and one surety in like sum. Attempt to get Sowore and his co-defendants released suffered setback last weekend, as the Nigeria Police Force could not produce them in court. Their lawyer, Marshal Abubakar, stated then that the police claimed to have handed the case file to a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) for further prosecution. According to him, the DIG who was called to produce the defendants, however, claimed to have handed the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution on the instruction of the Attorney General of the Federation. The defendants were arrested on the New Year eve in Abuja and were consequently arraigned on a three-count bordering on criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly and attempting to incite others. They pleaded not guilty to the charges. This made the chief magistrate to adjourn the matter till yesterday.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
