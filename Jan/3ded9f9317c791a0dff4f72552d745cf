The Head Coach and High-Performance Manager of Cricket in Nigeria, Asanka Gurusinha has described the PwC National U-17 Cricket Championship as very important for the country’s cricket development pathway. “It is important for Nigeria’s grassroots development. I have followed this event, and must say I am impressed at the level of coordination by the Cricket Federation. Also, I am happy with the support the Sports Ministry has offered to made the event a success,” he said. Asanka continues: “This event is critical to Nigeria’s participating in future U-19 events, though the attention this year is to get capable players for executing the coming Under-19 World Cup qualifier later in the year. Most of the talents we have seen will form a pool from which National Under 19 coach will be working with.” The Sri Lankan Cricket World Cup winner, who was employed in 2020, said despite being his first national event to be witnessed in Nigeria, he is looking forward to the finals of the event. “I am very much looking forward to seeing the finals in Edo State.” The girls’ final is billed for January 27 to 31, while boys’ regional representatives will slug it out from February 4 to 7. Both finals have been scheduled to hold at Edo state high-performance center in Benin City. The General Manager of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, Emeka Igwillo, stated that all the regional teams coming for the finals would have all the needs to make sure they are safe and comfortable to play the best possible cricket. “We are leveraging on all the provisions, instructions, and support that the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is offering Sports federations at the critical times to make sure we keep all wards safe. “These includes implementation of Covid-19 protocols at all hostels, and match venues for the days that each of the finals would be holding. The Sports Ministry has been with us in these implementations all through the regional events, and we are glad at the level of success so far,” he said.
