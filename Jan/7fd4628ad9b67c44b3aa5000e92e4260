Adele And Enstranged Husband Reach Divorce Settlement After 2 Years Image WireImage Adele has reportedly reached an agreement with estranged husband Simon Konecki on their divorce settlement according to a report by The Mirror. According to the report by The Mirror, the 32-year-old singer filed judgement package with the court on January 15. This would come nearly two years after the couple announced they would be splitting, in April 2019. The pair have reportedly represented themselves throughout the discussions but they will not be officially divorced until a judge agrees and signs off the proposal. It is believed that Adele and Simon, 46, used mediation to carve up their properties and fortune. It has been a long process since Adele initially filed for divorce in September 2019, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split. At that time, the filing showed that they both wanted joint custody of their eight-year-old son Angelo, with visitations to be negotiated in the mediation process. In March 2020, they both signed a confidentiality agreement regarding the details of their divorce.
Adele and Simon had dated for seven years before they tied the knot in May 2018. In February 2019, Adele gifted Simon her home in Los Angeles before they separated two months later. In a statement at that time, the singer’s representative said: “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly.” Speaking to the media, a source said the relationship “didn’t work out” because it had “evolved” and they were, in the end, “more like friends than lovers.” Since the split, Adele has undergone a huge transformation as she lost seven stone after undertaking a diet and fitness regime that left her looking unrecognisable to her former self.
