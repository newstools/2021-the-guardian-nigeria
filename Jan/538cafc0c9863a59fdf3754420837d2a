•Troops kill 2,403 hoodlums, rescue 864 captives The Presidency has listed the achievements of the military in the ongoing fight against insurgency and violent crimes, as Nigeria marks this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day today. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, listed the feats yesterday in a write-up titled,  “Security Checklist: As Nigeria marks Armed Forces Remembrance Day.’’ According to him, the occasion provides opportunity to chronicle current landmark achievements by the military in tackling security challenges across the federation.

“Our Emirs were all in exile. Today, Bama Local Government is coming back to life and so are Askira-Uba, Damboa, Gwoza and others. Life is returning to Baga, which was impossible before. Zulum added: “In fact, it was not possible to move few kilometres out of Maiduguri.  Insurgents were so bold to attack and take over military facilities, like the Army Barracks at Monguno, Bama, Giwa Barrack and Multinational Joint Task Force Headquarters at Baga, to mention just a few. There were daily bomb blast attacks in many parts of Maiduguri, the most populated part of the state but all these have stopped.
