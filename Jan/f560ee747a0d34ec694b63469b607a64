 Capital market. Photo: SHUTTERSTOCK  Yesterday, the ASI shed 30.75 absolute points, representing a loss of 0.07 per cent to close at 41,051.63 points. Accordingly, investors lost N16 billion in value as market capitalisation went down to N21.475 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large value stocks, including Ardova Plc, BUA Cement, UAC of Nigeria (UACN), Access Bank, and Red Star Express Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said:  “Following two consecutive days of losses, we expect investors to take position in bell  wethers. “The domestic bourse again rode south on the back of declines in the Banking (-0.73%), Oil & Gas (-46bps), and Industrial goods (-0.27%) sectors. In spite of the attractive price levels of most fundamentally-sound stocks when compared to their target prices, trading sessions for the week have been largely controlled by the bears. “This is due to profit taking on gains made in the previous week. Given that the index has closed south in the last two sessions, we expect some bargain hunting activities to return tomorrow, driven by low prices.” However, sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive, as 43 stocks gained, relative to 21 losers.	Afromedia, Guinea Insurance, NEM Insurance, Prestige Assurance, Union Diagnostic & Clinical Services and Wapic Insurance recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent each, to close at 22 kobo, 22 kobo, N2.53, 55 kobo, 33 kobo, and 66 kobo per share, respectively.
