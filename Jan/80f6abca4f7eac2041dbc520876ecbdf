Director of Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, said only temperature checks should be carried out on students and any other person crossing any school gate. The ministry advised school authorities should, therefore, refrain from asking students or parents to undergo COVID-19 test before they are accepted in their schools. The Federal Government had, in a statement last week, urged teachers, school administrators and other stakeholders to ensure strict compliance with COVID-19 protocols, including compulsory wearing of facemasks by all students, teachers and workers in all schools, temperature checks and provision of hand washing facilities at strategic locations in all schools. Others are ensuring constant supply of water and sanitizers, enforcement of social distancing and suspension of large gatherings such as assembly and visiting days, and avoiding overcrowding, including limitations in class sizes and hostel occupancy. According to the statement, schools must ensure functional health clinics with facilities for isolation and transportation of suspected cases to medical facilities. There should also be adherence to all other non-pharmaceutical protocols, restrictions and containment measures as may be prescribed by the PTF from time to time. According to the statement, the measures, which are to ensure safe reopening of schools for academic activities, will be subject to constant review.
