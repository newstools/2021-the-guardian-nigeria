The Department of State Services (DSS) has pledged to ensure justice over an alleged killing of a policeman by its operatives. DSS spokesman Peter Afunanya in a statement assured that it will not condone any acts of indiscipline or injustice. “The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to the incident that led to the death of a Police Corporal in Osun State. Consequently, the Service and the Police are jointly investigating the matter. “The public should be rest assured that it will not condone any acts of indiscipline or injustice. It therefore calls on the media and other stakeholders to exercise patience and await the outcome of the investigations.” The Osun State Police Command had said an operative of the Department of State Services, David Olowoporoku, and two others perpetrated the alleged attack on a cop, Rauf Fawale, which claimed his life. Addressing newsmen at the state command headquarters on Tuesday, the police spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, said the DSS leadership had informed the state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, of ongoing disciplinary action against those involved in the matter. Corporal Fawale, a father of three attached to the Estate Police Division in Osogbo, on Sunday, January 24, 2021, died at a private hospital in Osogbo. He sustained a head injury after being attacked by three DSS men around Oke Fia.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
