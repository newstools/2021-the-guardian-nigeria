The Performing Musician Employers’ Association of Nigeria (PMAN) has commended the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria (MCSN) on the renewal of its CMO Licence. The development, coming at a time when musicians have not been collecting their due royalties for the performance of their musical works on broadcasting and digital platforms, including royalties from telecommunications companies, who are by far the biggest earners in the music industry. Reacting to the development, the National Working Committee headed by PMAN President, Pretty Okafor, in a letter dated January 20, pledged its full support to MCSN in its drive to administer royalty collection and distribution to rights owners and performers. “The PMAN President, Pretty Okafor and the Vice President Sunny Neji on behalf of the entire 36 states’ and Federal Capital Territory PMAN Chapters congratulate MCSN once again,” the letter read. Okafor said that PMAN as a body shall also be working in close collaboration with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and other government ministries and agencies to ensure that the relevant laws are complied with and effectively enforced.
