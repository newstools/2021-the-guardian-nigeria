Kaduna State high court has withdrawn the order it made which directed the Nigeria Correctional Service to release the wife of Shiites leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, Zeenah for COVID-19 treatment. The presiding judge, Justice Gideon Kurada, had on 26th January 2020 ordered the Government to release Zeenah after the Defence counsel, Femi Falana presented a medical report asking the court to allow his client seek medical treatment outside the correctional centre according to measures put in place by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Besides, the court revoked the initial order of her release after an oral application made by H.G. Magashi from the chambers of Falana (SAN) who claimed that the defendant has regained her health from COVID-19. “Upon an oral application moved by H.G. Magashi, Esq. holding the brief of Femi Falana SAN, counsel for the 1 defendant and of Edwin Inegedu, Esq. of counsel for the 2nd defendant applying for an order vacating an earlier order made on 26th January 2021 for 2nd defendant to be taken to a government hospital for treatment. “The situation has changed as the 2nd defendant regained her good health and the unfettered access to medical facilities granted her by the correctional services centre, Kaduna,” the judge said. “It is hereby ordered that the application is granted and the order of court made on 26 January 2021 is hereby vacated,” the judge said. Meanwhile, Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife have been in detention since 2015 after the shiites clashed with soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna. The leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), as the Islamic group is also called, is standing trial for alleged culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, and disruption of public peace.
