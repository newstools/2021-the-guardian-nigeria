The 11 distribution companies were only able to distribute 16,308 prepaid meters as of November 2020, while electricity consumers were yearning for units amidst estimated billings. This was contained in the latest figures from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) tagged: “Analysis of meter deployment across electricity distribution companies report for the month of November 2020.” The report also said Enugu, Benin, Ibadan and Yola Discos with 372,624 meters had yet to begin deployment as of the time the data was released.
