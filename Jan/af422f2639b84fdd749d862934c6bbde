• Say Nothing To Celebrate In Face Of Insecurity Threatening Nigeria Elders in the country have said the best way to celebrate the 2021 Armed Forces Remembrance Day would have been for President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the service chiefs and rejig the entire security architecture, following worsening insecurity in the country. They said there was nothing to celebrate in this year’s Remembrance Day because of the President’s inability to address the numerous problems confronting living members of the Armed Forces, especially the frontline troops. The elders in a statement, yesterday, vowed to begin imminent mobilisation of Nigerians against the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, if it fails to immediately prevail on the president to act swiftly on restructuring of security architecture to save the country from further misfortunes. The Elders, under the auspices of Coalition of Patriotic Nigerian Elders (COPANE), observed that the inability of pigeons to fly after being released by President Buhari during yesterday’s event in Abuja to mark the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, was a strong indication that Nigeria was not at peace. The statement was signed by the group’s National Coordinator, Prof. Habu Usman Galadima, National Secretary, Dr. (Mrs.) Grace Onanefe and Legal Adviser, Barr. Muhammad Ibrahim Potiskum. “While we celebrate and pray for our heroes past, who had served our dear country and paid the ultimate price as members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, we wish to state that there is nothing to celebrate in this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day, because of Mr. President’s inability to address the numerous problems confronting members of the Armed Forces alive, especially those in the frontlines. “We observe with regret that the long and unnecessary tenure of the current service chiefs has not only affected career progression in the Armed Forces of Nigeria today, but has also resulted in low morale among officers and men of the services besides other forms of setbacks. This is unconstitutional… The elders said the president’s speech at the Remembrance Day was empty, given that it failed to address insecurity threatening the country. “We make bold to say Nigerians were not interested in the president’s speech today, because it does not address their yearnings, which is the long overdue sack of the nation’s service chiefs. The arguments by some selfish persons around Mr. President that he should not change the guard during war are the most irresponsible, misplaced, selfish and unprofessional arguments. “Secondly, what if this current service chiefs are the reason the war has refused to end?… As elders, we are aware that several eminent Nigerians have appealed to the president, both publicly and privately to relieve the service chiefs of their positions in face of the dwindling security problems in the country; yet, all have fallen on deaf ears. “We, however, wish to remind Mr. President that we are still in a constitutional democracy, where the people’s voice is the ultimate. To this end, it is our humble appeal that Mr. President listens to the voice of people by not only relieving the service chiefs of their positions, but also restructuring the entire security architecture without further delay.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
