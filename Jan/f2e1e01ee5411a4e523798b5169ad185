Justice Nasiru Saminu has set aside the judgment of Upper Sharia court that sentence one Yahaya Sheriff to death by hanging and ordered for immediate retrial. In his judgment on an appeal, Justice Saminu declared that the ruling on the lower court was full of irregularities and thereby lack reputable merit to stand. Yahaya was found guilty of blasphemy for altering foul language against prophet Muhammad and sentenced to death. While ruling on the appeal Justice Saminu insisted Yahaya was not given a fare hearing. He directed the retrial of the case to another Sharia judge.
