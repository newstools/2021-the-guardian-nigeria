 Golden Eaglets  Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Amoo stated that the Golden Eaglets qualification for the African U-17 Championship in Morocco in March would give the technical crew enough time to give the players the tutorial they need to excel at the African cadet tournament. He stated that playing against tough opposition like the Baby Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire in the final of the WAFU championship, which the Eaglets lost 2- 3 would assist him to raise the performance level of the players in subsequent competitions. The Golden Eaglets coach stressed that the team would be given more mental and tactical discipline ahead of the Morocco 2021 championship. Amoo also added that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) would release the guidelines on the Eaglet’s preparations for the African championship in due time. He said: “Stagefright, anxiety, and lack of exposure affected the Eaglets in Togo. The boys allowed the pressure of meeting teams from other parts of Africa to overwhelm them. Based on the experience they got in Togo, I believe the boys have the prospect to shine in Morocco. “The players I took to Togo were good, although their performance has exposed lapses, which will be corrected as the team progresses. At this point, I will not say I will inject new players to beef up the Eaglets, time will tell if such a move would be necessary,” he said.
