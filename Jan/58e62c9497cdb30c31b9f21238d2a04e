 Okowa.

He, therefore, urged Nigerians to seek God’s face in prayers for the solution to the challenges, especially economic and insecurity plaguing Nigeria. “We have political leaders, who are not ready and willing to make sacrifices towards ending the economic and insecurity challenges facing the country.” Gbemre said it was worrisome that a governor of Okowa’s status was leaving the security challenges to prayers without corresponding actions, stressing that religious fanaticism and over zealousness has made Nigerians think that prayers alone could solve all of our problems, forgetting that even the Bible said: “Prayer without works is dead.” He said it was shameful that the Federal Government and governors admitted that they were overwhelmed by insecurity and economic challenges in the country? He urged them to resign if really they were overwhelmed, adding: “This is what Okowa’s statement implies. Nobody placed a gun on their heads to seek elections for President and governors in Nigeria. And if they can no longer stand the heat of their offices, they should quit.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
