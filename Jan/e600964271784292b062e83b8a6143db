The Department of State Services (DSS) has pledged to ensure justice over an alleged killing of a policeman by its operatives. Spokesman of the plain-cloth security agency, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement, assured that it would not condone any act of indiscipline or injustice. According to Afunanya, “The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to the incident that led to the death of a Police Corporal in Osun State. Consequently, the service and the police are jointly investigating the matter. “The public should be rest assured that it will not condone any act of indiscipline or injustice. It, therefore, calls on the media and other stakeholders to exercise patience and await the outcome of the investigations.” The Osun State Police Command had said an operative of the DSS, David Olowoporoku, and two others were perpetrators of the alleged attack on a cop, Rauf Fawale, which claimed his life. Addressing newsmen at the state command headquarters on Tuesday, the police spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, said the DSS leadership had informed the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Wale Olokode, of ongoing disciplinary action against those involved in the matter. Corporal Fawale, a father of three attached to the Estate Police Division in Osogbo, on Sunday, January 24, 2021, died at a private hospital in Osogbo. He sustained a head injury after he was allegedly attacked by three DSS men around Oke Fia.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
