A graduate of Harvard and of Tulane Medical School, Levine is also the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. Additionally, she is a public speaker and author on several issues, including the opioid crisis, medical marijuana, adolescent medicine, eating disorders and LGBTQ medicine, The Hill reported. Joe Biden’s administration is set to become the most inclusive administration in U.S history, as as he has tapped LGBTQ appointees for several key roles. In November 2020, Karine Jean-Pierre, an out lesbian and chief of staff for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, was announced as deputy press secretary, and Pili Tobar, an immigration rights advocate and former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer, was named deputy White House communications director. Tobar, a lesbian, also worked as a communications director for the Biden campaign. Also in November, Carlos Elizondo, who is gay and was Biden’s social secretary when Biden was vice president, was named White House social secretary.
