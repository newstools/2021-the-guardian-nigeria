The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Maiduguri Zonal Office, has arraigned Aisha Wakil, popularly known as ‘Mama Boko Haram’, before Justice Aisha Kumaliya of the Borno State High Court sitting in Maiduguri, on a fresh three-count charge of criminal conspiracy and obtaining N41,777,750 by false pretence. She was arraigned alongside the Programme Manager of Complete Care and Aid Foundation, Tahiru Daura; and the Country Director of the non-governmental organisation, Lawal Shoyede. The defendants allegedly induced one Bilkisu Abubakar to a contract worth N41 million for the NGO owned by Wakil, but failed to pay. The allegations are contrary to Section 320 (a) and punishable under Section 322 of the Penal Code Cap 102 Laws of Borno State. With the defendants’ not-guilty plea to the charges preferred against them, the prosecuting counsel, Haruna Abdulkadiri, asked the court to fix a date for trial, to enable the first and third defendants, who did not have legal representation, to come with their counsel. Justice Kumaliya adjourned till January 26, 2021 for commencement of trial and ordered ‘Mama Boko Haram’ and Shoyede to engage the services of counsel of their choice, failing which the EFCC would be at liberty to proceed with its case without their counsel.
