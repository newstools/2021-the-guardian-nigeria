Residents Ogbor Hill Aba, yesterday, rejoiced over the rehabilitation of Ebenma, First Avenue and Egege/Ama Ohafia roads within Egege Layout in Aba North Council of Abia State. Their commissioning was performed by representative of the Catholic pontiff and Apostolic Nuncio (Head of Diplomatic Missions) to Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, Antilles, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname, Most Reverend Fortunatus Nwachukwu. He prayed for longevity of the highways and lauded the deployment of right technology for their reconstruction. In his remarks, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu said the roads, which had been dilapidated for 26 years, were re-built to last 40 years owing to use of rigged pavement and asphalt. Also inaugurated was Osusu road, a major access road to Ariaria Market, Aba, which was similarly abandoned for years. The governor, while inspecting ongoing construction works on Ngwa, Ohanku and Obohia roads in Aba South Council, hinted that Omuma road, another access road to the international market, was being rehabilitated. He urged residents to protect projects and infrastructure sited in their domains and also make good use of them. Chairman of Aba Chamber of Commerce, Mines and Agriculture, Chief Lawrence Obete, commended the governor for the repairs, adding that the gesture would boost commercial activities in the town. Also speaking, the council chairmen, Prince David Ikonne and Mr. Emma Clinton Ebere, lauded Ikpeazuâ€™s leadership style.
