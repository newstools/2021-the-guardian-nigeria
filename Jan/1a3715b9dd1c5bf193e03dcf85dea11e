For the second year running, Nigeria fell from its 146th placing in 2019 to 149th spot last year in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) released yesterday by Transparency International (TI). Reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the scorecard was a confirmation of the “failure of President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption crusade.”It stated that the TI report, which put Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in 2020,  “is an incontrovertible confirmation that our nation is more corrupt under President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) than it was in 2015 when they took office.” The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, lamented that “this descent into the abyss of corruption only goes to show that President Buhari’s anti-corruption stance is a mere swindle used to delude Nigerians while the vaults were laid open for APC leaders and officials of the Buhari administration to plunder.” It added: “The record of unbroken decline from 136th in 2016 to 144th in 2018, 146th in 2019 and now 149th in 2020, under President Buhari, the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion, settles the now notorious fact that the Buhari administration and the APC are titleholders in corruption.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
