The Director General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has warned this year’s “B” Stream II prospective corps members against night journeys as they prepare to proceed to the various NYSC camps across the country for their orientation programme. Ibrahim gave this warning yesterday during a sensitisation webinar jointly organised by the NYSC and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the prospective corps members ahead of the commencement of the orientation exercise. In a statement yesterday, he urged them to avoid actions that could put their lives at risk. Ibrahim advised the prospective corps members to break their journey if they would travel a long distance before getting to their states of deployment. He also warned them to adhere strictly to all the COVID-19 safety protocols, adding that only those who test negative for COVID-19 would be allowed to register at the orientation camps. He disclosed that the scheme would not hesitate to decamp anyone who fails to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols while in camp. “Please don’t travel at night and don’t endanger your security. Kindly stay safe. If you are sick, let us know and don’t jeopardise the orientation course. We will not hesitate to decamp anyone who fails to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols,” he warned. The NYSC boss appealed to the prospective corps members to report to camp on the dates on their call-up letters in order to avoid large gathering, so as to safeguard the lives of camp participants. He commended the NCDC for assisting the NYSC to sensitise the prospective corps members in its bid to stem the tide of COVID-19. Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, speaking during the event, called on the prospective corps members to join hands with the NYSC and NCDC by keeping to the rules so as to have a successful service year.
