However, the Police Command in Oyo State, said that hoodlums set the house on fire. The command’s spokesman, CSP Olugbenga Fadeyi, confirmed that the command also received a report on the incident. Adeyemo (Igboho), popularly known as Sunday Igboho, recently gave a seven-day ultimatum to herders in the Ibarapa axis of Oyo State to leave the area. He alleged that herders have been responsible for the killings and kidnappings of the residents of Oke-Ogun and Ibarapa. But Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State insisted that the herders were not responsible for the insecurity. Adeyemo later invaded Igangan community in Ibarapa axis of Oyo State on Jan. 22, resulting in a clash in the community.
