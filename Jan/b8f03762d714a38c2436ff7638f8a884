T.I. and Tiny | Image: Kevin Winter T.I. and his wife Tameka ‘Tiny’ Harris have denied a string of sexual allegations levelled against them by Sabrina Peterson. The latest round of allegations are in a series of screenshots of DMs from over 15 women accusing the rapper and his wife of disturbing incidents of sexual abuse and other transgressions allegedly from more than a dozen women. Peterson compiled the allegations which claimed that the women were forced to take drugs and “pressured for sex.” A spokesperson for T.I. (real name Clifford Joseph Harris Jr.) and Tiny (Tameka Dianne Harris) responded to the sexual abuse allegations in a joint statement to Billboard on Friday (Jan. 29). “Mr. and Mrs. Harris want to be on record and more importantly want the public to know they emphatically deny in the strongest way possible the egregiously appalling allegations being made against them by Sabrina Peterson. “The Harrises have had difficulty with this woman for well over a decade. They are taking this matter very seriously, and if these allegations don’t end, they will take appropriate legal action.” Peterson, who is a former friend of the Harris family had also accused T.I. of holding a gun to her head in writing on her Instagram page: “you PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD IN FRONT OF CHILDREN & I NEVER CALLED THE POLICE ON YOU! But for years you have painted me as the VILLAIN!” Tiny Harris and T.I. | Image: Getty Images Responding to the gun claim allegation from Peterson, Tiny defended her husband earlier this week by responding to a comment on The Shade Room: “Hold up… So you want your abuser to train your sons? He was just uncle 2 years ago Now when did you say my husband assaulted you? Did you change your mind or change it back? What wit you today Pooh? I’m confused. Stop Harassing My Family. You strange. Everybody know you been special (face slicing seminar lady). Please get help but LEAVE US ALONE.”
