Member, House of Representatives, representing Numan, Lamurde and Demsa Federal Constituency in Adamawa State on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Kwamoti Laori, said the real reasons some party chieftains defect to other parties was that Governor Ahmadu Fintiri refused to share state funds to people he described as “political merchants.” Speaking, yesterday, in Yola, a week after former governor, Bala Ngillari, said he left the party because it was dead and would be buried in 2023,  Laori alleged that some chieftains made unrealistic demands from the governor to the masses’ detriment. “Some people mistook the present government for past administrations, where money meant for infrastructure and human empowerment was shared and real voters were left in abject poverty. This is a different government with people’s interest as its priority. They are free to go to any party. Adamawa PDP is not Bureau de change, where foreign currencies exchange hands,” he said. He alleged that none of the decampees ever won an election without PDP. “ Governor Fintiri has changed Adamawa’s political narratives. Bigwigs no longer decide the winners in elections, but real voters do. “ I challenge anybody to come out and say there is no project going on in his local council. The good thing is that these projects are visible and nobody can dispute that,” he said. He said PDP and Fintiri would have no opposition in 2023, pointing out that the forthcoming governorship election would be “Operation show me your projects” He advised the people not to be distracted by those he described as “commercial politicians.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
