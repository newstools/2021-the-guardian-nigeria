Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has asked a Makurdi High Court to fix a date for definite hearing in his N10 billion libel suit against former chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, and the party. Oshiomhole had sought out-of-court settlement with Ortom, which was communicated to the court on October 13, 2020. The presiding judge, Justice Augustine Ityonyiman, consequently adjourned the case till October 29, 2020 for report on the settlement. After two adjournments, with the last on December 16, 2020, the case resumed yesterday for report on the settlement. Ladi Achibong, who held brief for Ortom’s counsel, Samuel Irabor, told the court that the out-of-court settlement had failed, as it appeared that the defendants were not serious with it. But Titus Akuha, who stood in for counsel to Oshiomhole and APC, Festus Jumbo, opposed the submission of Ortom’s lawyer. He said that all the terms of settlement had been met, except one; hence the settlement could not be said to have failed. Ityoyiman, after listening to counsel to the parties, adjourned the case till February 26, 2021 for report on the settlement or definite hearing.
