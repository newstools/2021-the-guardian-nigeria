U.S. Ambassador, Mary Leonard explained that the new equipment would enhance the Consulate’s capacity to provide reliable data on air quality, thereby highlighting the United States’ commitment to environmental sustainability. “Through a team effort, we have successfully procured air quality monitors for Abuja Embassy and Lagos Consulate through the Greening Diplomacy Initiative’s Department of State’s Air program. ‘This will strengthen our ability to collect and share reliable data on air quality as it corresponds to the time of the day and the seasons of the year.” Ambassador Leonard said.
