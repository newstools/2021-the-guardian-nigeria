The 2020 national December retreat of the Deeper Life Bible Church ended on a good note despite the uncertainties that surrounded it amid renewed restrictions following the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In response to the government directive, the National December Retreat, themed: ‘Turning bitterness to sweetness,’ which usually held at the Deeper Life campground on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, was scaled down.
 
Initially, the retreat was scheduled to take place at the group headquarters (comprising about 6/7 districts), but due to the Lagos State government directive, which came at the eleventh hour, that church gatherings should not be more than 50 per cent capacity, the church hurriedly came up with contingency plan, especially in Lagos, to hold the retreat at district levels to accommodate fewer number of worshipers.
