 Buhari. Photo: TWITTER/NIGERIAGOV  Albert said this on Tuesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. The expert said that Buhari had responded to the yearnings of Nigerians by the removal of the service chiefs. Albert, however, said the removal of the service chiefs only would not solve the security challenges facing the country. He urged the president to move to the next stage by addressing other challenges such as inadequate equipment and military personnel. Albert also called on the military to improve their relationship with the community they operate. He said that the war against terrorism and banditry cannot be won without winning the minds of the people in communities the military operates. Also speaking a human rights lawyer, Mr Oladimeji Adebayo, said that the security situation in Nigeria would improve with the appointment of the new service chiefs. Adebayo said the new service chiefs would bring new ideas that would improve the security situation in the country and would want to make an impact. “I think they are going to do their best and justify the confidence imposed on them by Nigerians. “We expect to improve the security situation in the country now,” he said. The new services chiefs appointed by the president are Chief of Defence Staff, Maj.Gen. Leo Irabor, Chief of Army Staff, Maj.Gen. I Attahiru, Rear Admiral A. Z. Gamboa, Chief of Naval Staff and Air- Vice Marshal I. O Amao, Chief of Air Staff.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
