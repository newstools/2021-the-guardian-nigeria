He added that the former Vice Chancellor’s death came at a time his wealth of experience and sterling knowledge of education management were needed most in the state and country. “The news of the death of my uncle and lecturer, Ibidapo-Obe, came as a rude shock. But we submit to the will of God and pray that the Almighty grants repose to his soul,” the statement reads. BESIDES, Vice Chancellor of UNILAG, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said the news of Ibidapo-Obe’s death came as a rude shock, because of the service and dedication he put into “developing the institution since he joined as a student in 1968, later as a staff and as the 8th Vice Chancellor of the university between 2000 and 2007.” SIMILARLY, former Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Peter Okebukola, said Ibidapo-Obe’s death was shocking, saying he was yet to process the news that broke on Sunday, January 3, 2021. “Can my friend of about 21 years go just like that? Our close interaction started while he was Vice Chancellor of UNILAG and I was Executive Secretary of NUC.” “Nigeria has lost a university administrator of special ilk and a scholar of immense lustre. I have lost a friend and brother. May his soul rest in perfect peace,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
