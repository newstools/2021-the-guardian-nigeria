 Audu Ogbeh  The former Minister of Agriculture urged the current administration to urgently look into the matter. In a statement yesterday, the one-time PDP national chairman said during the National Executive Council (NEC) of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) last October, “our members, particularly those from Sokoto and Zamfara, reported that large consignments of camels were crossing the borders into Nigeria with a lot of baggage on their backs on a daily basis.” He added: “And they observed that nobody checks their baggage and nobody knows what is being brought into Nigeria.” According to him, “the question ACF would like to ask the security agencies is: what are the camels carrying and where are they heading?” Ogbeh went on: “The ACF is alarmed that this kind of situation should persist at a time when weapons of all kinds are coming into our country and worsening the climate of terror and national uncertainty.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
