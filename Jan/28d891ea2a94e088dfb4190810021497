She said that the command destroyed two marijuana farms at Ajani village in Ona-Ara and Oluyole local government areas. She further disclosed that the command had no fewer than 51 people undergoing counselling. She added that “there is hope for people who use drugs, so parents and loved ones should never give up on them. “Stakeholders must work together to get useful information on drug abuse to win the fight against trafficking in our communities. “The NDLEA command appreciates the support from the state government and other stakeholders during the year.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 133 arrests in 2020 indicates a decrease compared with 201 recorded in 2019.
