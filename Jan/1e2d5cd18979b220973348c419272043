The Federal Government has appreciated Nigerians for their perseverance in the ongoing NIN-SIM linkage exercise. A statement on Tuesday from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), signed by the Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, said at the end of a review meeting on January 18, 2021, the Technical Implementation Committee under the Ministerial Task Force has reported significant progress in the ongoing NIN-SIM linkage exercise. Adinde disclosed that so far a total of 47.8 million NINs have been collected by the mobile operators. According to him, at an average of three to four SIMs per subscriber. This means sim cards are expected to be linked up before the deadline in February 2021. Reacting to the report, the minister expressed satisfaction with this commendable achievement. He expressed the Federal Government’s appreciation for the commitment demonstrated by all stakeholders and citizens and urged them to submit their NINs before February 9, 2021 deadline. The minister urged the technical team to fast-track the processes so that the project is delivered soonest. The technical committee drew attention to the app developed by FGN which allows subscribers to link up to a maximum of seven SIMs to their NIN. The minister reminds Nigerians to secure and protect their NINs, urging subscribers to desist from selling their NINs or allowing others to use their NINs for registration. “For any action committed with the SIM good or bad it will be officially traced and attached to the NIN owner,” the minister warned.
