 Peter Obi  In a statement to The Guardian by the chairman of its Board of Trustees, Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi and Head of Good Governance, Chinwe Umeche, Intersociety declared that the move to deny Anambra South the governorship slot in the November 6 governorship poll is akin to changing a central referee at the middle of a crucial football match.  “Snatching the Anambra governorship by ‘clever’ and under the disguise of Nwadi-Ani or Ndi Nnem Ochie, thereby paving the way for same Senatorial District with 11 years of uninterrupted occupation of the same seat (May 29, 2003 – March 17, 2014) is not only unfair and greedy, but must also not be allowed.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
