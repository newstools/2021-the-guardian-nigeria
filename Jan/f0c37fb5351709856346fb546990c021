As Bauchi gov commissions 10.3km road in Ogoni Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has declared that his administration would complete all projects it awarded before the end of his tenure, stressing that unlike some politicians who abandon projects halfway, his administration will not abandon any projects. He gave the assurance yesterday at the unveiling of the 10.3km Sime-Nonwa-Kira road in Tai Council Area, which was performed by Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed. He said he was committed to ensuring that all local government areas in the state would receive a fair share of their development projects. Governor Wike berated a former Commissioner for Community and Chieftaincy Affairs for peddling falsehood that there were no development projects in Ogoni land, maintaining that such people who took kola meant for traditional rulers could see and speak the truth, but waste their energies defending what they could not defend. Unveiling the road, Governor Mohammed commended his Rivers State counterpart for delivering the road project that connects several communities aimed at easing movement of rural dwellers. Mohammed said he was proud to be a Nigerian anytime he sees how Governor Wike had continued to deliver democratic dividends to Rivers people, in spite of the challenges facing the state and entire country. His words: “When I see the quality of the road and the community where it is sited, traversing all these communities and the kind of good sermon given by the Council Chairman and the Commissioner for Works, I felt elated to be a Nigerian. “This is so, because here is a Nigerian governor who has been able to deepen leadership by bringing people with capacity on board and using  local contractors to ensure local content. “This is the kind of Nigeria we need. We need more leaders who can bring people with quality and capacity on board.”
On his part, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi, said the road traversed several communities, including the Barayira, Barale, Gboroba, Nonwa, Kira, Sime and Eteo. “The road used to be a glorified track road with multiple failed sections and its attendant consequences. The people, their livelihoods and their vehicles, income and time were affected. “But today, through Governor Wike’s foresight and doggedness, we now have a standard 10.3km road, which is 7.3m wide with a drainage network of 5.7km,” he stated. Chairman of Tai Council Area, Dr. Jacobson Nbina, expressed gratitude of the Ogoni people to Governor Wike for keeping his promises to the people.
