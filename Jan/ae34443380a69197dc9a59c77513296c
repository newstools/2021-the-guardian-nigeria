This is contained in a statement signed on Sunday by the Agency’s Head, Public Affairs Unit, Mr Femi Moliki. Moliki said that five of the vehicles had been transferred to the Lagos State Taskforce on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences. He said that the sixth, a Mercedes Benz ML 350, was intercepted and impounded on Victoria Island  by the officers of the squad around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday. “The driver of the vehicle, one Adam Oluremi, 32, threatened and mobilised a military man to shoot the officers. “The officers professionally de-escalated the crisis and successfully towed the vehicle to the RRS Headquarters,” Moliki said.
