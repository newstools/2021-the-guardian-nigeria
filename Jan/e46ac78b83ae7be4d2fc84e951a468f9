He also berated the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babajide Ojudu, for his statement that he collected money from All Progressives Congress’ National Leader, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during the Ekiti State governorship re-run election in 2009. He described the senator as an “irritant, detractor and enemy of Yorubaland.” Adeyemo put the items destroyed at N50 million. The rights activist, while speaking with journalists at his residence in the same Soka area, which is different from the one torched, said those who attacked one of his houses were not men enough. He said they should have come to where he stays if the arsonists were bold enough. “What baffled me most is that I don’t expect we, the Yoruba, should be supporting the Fulani herdsmen and kidnappers to confront me on this struggle I am pursuing. What baffled most is that some Yoruba people are supporting Fulani herdsmen to raze my house. That startled me and saddened my heart a lot. I am not suspecting anyone for now. But I know it could not have happened without internal collaborators. “They want to include politics in my fight against Fulani herdsmen. They want to destroy my name. No politician can pay me for what I am doing and none can boast of sponsoring me,” he said.
MEANWHILE, the Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the attack. In a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, yesterday, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Olugbenga Fadeyi, said the investigation had commenced into the incident. The Chief Press Secretary to Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, yesterday, warned opposition elements in the state to stop playing politics with the insecurity situation in Ibarapa and Oke-Ogun parts of the state. The governor’s aide maintained that most of the comments attributed to opposition elements on the security situation missed the point due to pettiness, contempt, and clear attempt to play to the gallery. According to him, if opposition elements were true lovers of the state, they should have used the occasion to demonstrate patriotism. He added that merely playing to the gallery only showcases them as ordinary politicians who do not think about the state but solely about the next election.
