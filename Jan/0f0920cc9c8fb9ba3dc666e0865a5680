Alibaba Veteran Nigerian comedian Alibaba in an Instagram post has shared his experience with coronavirus. He shared the video on his page and reminded everyone of the need to continue to keep safe as Covid-19 is not a joke or scam as widely speculated by many Nigerians. In the shared video, he sympathized with all those who have loved a lost one to the virus and also warned Nigerians about the second wave of Covid that has been reported to be deadlier than the first wave. Reminding all to continue to wear their masks, he disclosed that he spent his Christmas in hospital and witnessed covid-related deaths. Slamming those who believe covid-19 is not real, he advised that people should stay away from people with such mindsets as the virus is very much real. Watch his video HERE. He captioned the video: “Don’t let anyone tell you it’s a scam. I just came out of isolation. Several people died while I was there. Some of my close friends knew and they were very supportive.

COVID is real. Observe all the protocols.

People are dying. And it’s not a joke

In fact, anyone who says COVID is a scam is a compound idiot and a fool.”
