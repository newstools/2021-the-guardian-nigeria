A woman was attacked, yesterday, along Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos while passersby watched. She was left with bruised face, a broken finger and a gash on her thigh. Her sister, whose name appeared on Twitter as Lisa Folawiyo, said: “It was my sister screaming. She was mugged and really roughed up. Traumatic. She screamed but no one helped. Everyone walked by like nothing was happening. I love humans. “Other than the broken finger, bruised up face and hands and  a gash in her thigh, she’s doing okay. Thank God. It could have been worse. But it has left her quite shaken and traumatised.” People have been advised to be careful when jogging on the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge as joggers are now getting attacked while streetlights are off. “Please, if you know anyone living in Lekki Phase 1/Ikoyi and they love running or walking on the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge, tell them to do their cardio when the day is bright. Today, by 5:40 am, we heard a lady screaming for help on the bridge.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
