The Rivers State Government has distanced itself from the posters bearing Governor Nyesom Wike’s pictures, which flooded some parts of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) yesterday. In a statement issued by the Commissioner for Information and Communication, Paulinus Nsirim, it insisted that the posters, which sought support for Wike presidency in 2023 was the handiwork of mischief makers, who are threatened by his (Wike’s) rising political profile. “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Wike has not informed anyone that he is interested in the presidency of this country. We are amused that detractors will stop at nothing to see how they can distract Wike’s visionary leadership” “And for the umpteenth time, we wish to restate that Governor Wike is presently preoccupied with his mission to make Rivers State a better place and destination of choice for Nigerians and investors,” the statement reads. Nsirim, who said all the immature antics of political jobbers aimed at heating up the polity would fail, urged members of the public to disregard the misinformation currently circulating in Abuja.
