Other occupants of the ill-fated bus sustained injuries. The Guardian gathered that the incident occurred yesterday when a truck lost control and rammed into a bus travelling from the eastern part of the country to the northern part. A witness said that a nursing mother and some children were among the commuters whose bodies evacuated from the bus. Few passengers survived the tragedy. Confirming the incident to newsmen, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Benue State, Mohammed Suleiman, said 12 people died while six others sustained varying degrees of injury. Last week, a picnic bus carrying passengers from Vandeikya Council to Makurdi crashed at Asukunya in Tarka Council, killing seven out of the nine occupants, while the two survivors are still nursing injuries in the hospital.
