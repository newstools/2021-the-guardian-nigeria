Residents of Royal Estate, Isheri Olofin, in Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area (LCDA), have called on the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Inspector of General of Police, to bring to justice the killers of Sunday Ajinda, a building contractor who was allegedly clubbed to death by some irate youths in the community.
 
Narrating how the deceased was murdered in cold blood, one of his apprentice and relative, Tosin Ajinda, said they were working at a site in the estate when his uncle asked him to call the okada rider that usually transported him.
 
He said: “On that fateful day, my uncle asked the bike man who usually takes him to other sites to come around. The bike man came and as he attempted to climb on it, two Hausa boys accosted him, saying he stole their okada. He tried to explain to them it could be a mistaken identity. He asked them if they didn’t know him and told them to follow him to the security post for verification.  Meanwhile, the CDA chairman led some members of the community to the palace of the traditional ruler in the area, Oniseri of Isheri, Oba Ayinde Balogun, demanding the relocation of the Hausa-Fulani community from their midst on  account of their incessant attacks on residents.
