Speaking on her performance, Onyebuchi said the two weeks camping organised by the sports ministry gave her the impetus and the much needed exposure for the maiden Champion of Champions wrestling tournament. “In December, the president of the federation called us for a two-week camping. That one really helped a lot. The kind of training I had in the camp, I can say it has been like three months now since I had that kind of training back home,” she said. Also, speaking on his feat, Amas, said: “As an elite athlete, you know you get to do the homework. Though we’ve been having challenges training together for a while because of COVID-19.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
