 sraeli forces surround the body of a Palestinian man shot by the army after he allegedly attempted to carry out a knife attack in the occupied West Bank HAZEM BADER AFP  “A knife attack was reported at the Gush Etzion junction, south of Bethlehem,” the army said in a statement. “The attacker was neutralised.” The attacker “is dead”, the army told AFP, confirming that the military had killed the assailant. The military later said the incident took place at a bus station, where soldiers were providing security to Israelis, with the suspect “running” at the forces while brandishing a stick with three knives fastened to it. It said no military personnel were wounded in the attack. Gush Etzion is a bloc of two dozen Israeli settlements and outposts near Bethlehem. There is frequent friction at the nearby junction, which has been the site of numerous so-called lone wolf Palestinian attacks. Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War. There are currently about 475,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank living in communities considered illegal by most of the international community, alongside some 2.8 million Palestinians. All Jewish settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by most of the international community.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
