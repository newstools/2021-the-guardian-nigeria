As Nigerians struggle to acquire the National Identity Number (NIN) from offices of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) nationwide, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said some unscrupulous persons are cashing in on the exercise to induce enrollees to sell their unique digits for a fee. The agency’s spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, who made the disclosure yesterday in Abuja, explained that the buyers were also reselling.
Clarifying that it is illegal to sell NIN, Uwujaren warned the seller risks vicarious liability for any act of criminality linked to the number. “In other words, they risk arrest and prosecution for any act of criminality linked to their NIN whether they are directly responsible or not for the crime. “The commission warns members of the public against selling their NIN and to report anyone seeking to buy their NIN to the nearest office of the EFCC or other law enforcement agencies,” he added.
