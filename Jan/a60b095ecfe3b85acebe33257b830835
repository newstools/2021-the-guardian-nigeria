As the Leopard golf tournament and Beauty Pageant tee-off today at Abeokuta Golf Club, the organising body has reiterated the need for all participants to maintain COVID-19 protocols as advised by the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF). Coordinator of the event, Ms Sumbo Oshile, in her enlightenments campaign prior to the tee-off, spoke on useful precautionary measures the expected participants and golfers need to follow. Speaking on the course items, before the round, she advised that all rakes and ball-retrievers should be removed, while ball washers and drinking fountains must be covered up. She also stated that benches and bins should be removed, covered, or sign-posted in such a way that players don’t touch them. On the hole and flagstick, the organiser advised that flagsticks could be retained, but strongly recommended that a sign is put on the flagstick indicating that it is not to be touched. She added: “A method of inserting the hole liner should to be used, which means all the ball does not fall below the surface of the putting green, and can be easily retrieved by handling the ball only.” She further reminded the golfers to keep two meters (six feet) apart at teeing areas, as well as avoid normal close proximity to one another when tee shots are played.
 Oshile urged golfers to limit themselves to one person per golf cart after the round, unless the occupants reside in the same household. “Rental golf carts (motorised or pull carts) must be extensively cleaned and disinfected after each rental. Golfers, fortunately, are absolutely groomed to the tradition of rules as well responsibility in general,” Oshile, a former Lady Captain of Tiger Club and Ibadan Golf Club stated.
