Former world No.4 Caroline Garcia of France also got her season on a positive note, ousting Australian wildcard Arina Rodionova, 6-3, 6-4. “It was a lot of emotions to get back on court, finally,” said Garcia. “I tried to stay very calm and play one point at a time, and I think I improved during the match, so that’s the most positive thing about today.” Other first-round Gippsland Trophy winners included former top 10 player Daria Kasatina of Russia and Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.
