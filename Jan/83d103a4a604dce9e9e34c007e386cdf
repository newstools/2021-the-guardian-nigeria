The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned members of the public that the commission was not undertaking any recruitment exercise; and remain wary of fraudsters. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, stated this yesterday in Abuja, explaining that the disclaimer was necessary due to activities of fake employment merchants and racketeers who open fake employment websites, collect money from unsuspecting members of the public and issue fake employment letters purporting to be acting on behalf of the commission. According to him, the recruitment of fresh graduates and experienced professionals had since been suspended. â€œWe advise everyone to discountenance all rumours of recruitment and letters of employment/recruitment purportedly emanating from the commission and duly inform security agencies of the scam. He added that the commission was a public trust and had always conducted its activities in the best tradition of openness and transparency.
