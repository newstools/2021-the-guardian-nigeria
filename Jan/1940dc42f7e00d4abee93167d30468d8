 [files] APC Flag  Secretary of APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, assured Nigerians that the party would do everything possible to observe all the protocols initiated by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 during the exercise that will hold from February 2 to 16 this year. Akpanudoedehe argued that the call for the suspension of the exercise due to a spike in COVID-19 cases in the country by a member of the House of Representatives, James Faleke, was unnecessary. “We thank Faleke for his concerns. We appreciate all the issues raised in his open letter, but as a committee, we are guided by the directive of NEC on the conduct of the registration and we wish to state that the exercise will continue as scheduled. “In doing this, we shall ensure full compliance with PTF protocols on COVID-19 in the cause of this exercise. Our registration officers will be adequately trained to observe the protocols by the PTF.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
