French President Emmanuel Macron lauded new US President Joe Biden's decision to return to the Paris climate accord on Wednesday, telling him "welcome back" in a congratulatory message after his inauguration. "Best wishes on this most significant day for the American people!" Macron tweeted in English. "We are together. We will be stronger to face the challenges of our time. Stronger to build our future. Stronger to protect our planet. Welcome back to the Paris Agreement!" Biden, who served as vice president under Barack Obama and first ran for president in 1987, plans to kick off his tenure with a flurry of 17 orders.

The accord committed all nations to cut carbon emissions to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and encouraged them to go down to 1.5 degrees.
