This followed the inferno that occurred last Thursday on the highway as a result of an explosion from a tanker after a collision with another truck, with the structure of the Airport Bridge significantly affected.
 
“The bridge, therefore, has to be temporarily closed to vehicular traffic movement to enable the state government conduct structural tests on the bridge,” the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, said yesterday.  MEANWHILE, a truck carrying steel rods yesterday fell on its side at Marine Bridge, blocking the bridge. Upon the arrival of emergency responders at the scene, it was observed that a tipper truck with registration number FST59XW, loaded with granite stones, fell on the road, obstructing free flow of traffic.
 
Further investigation revealed that the accident occurred while the tipper tried to avoid a collision with a saloon car.
 
A statement by the Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said no loss of life or injury was recorded at the scene of the incident, adding that the loaded granite had been trans-loaded into another truck.
