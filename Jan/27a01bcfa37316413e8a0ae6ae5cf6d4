Two things of note here: One, moving the Remembrance Day from November 11 to January 15, means Nigeria no longer participates in the Poppy Day for the WWII veterans in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and two, the soldiers remembered are those on the Federal side only, and this contradicts General Gowon’s “No Victor, No Vanquished” proclamation at the end of the internal struggles and hostilities within Nigeria on January 15, 1970. No country sets aside a day for celebrating soldiers that quelled internal strife.
 
Within the history of Nigeria, January 15 deserves to be upheld and remembered as Peace and Unity Day. Indeed, a truly Nigerian National day, as it commemorates the end of the civil war and the return of peace and subsequent re-unification of Nigeria.
 
Raising the status of the day to a full national public holiday will help to promote a sense of history and generate a healthy discussion on how not to repeat the follies that led to the civil war. 
 
January 15 is apt for a truly Nigerian public holiday, serving as a yearly reminder of the benefits of peace and unity towards the national development and prosperity of Nigeria, consistent with the repeated calls for genuine peace and unity that have dominated national discourse since 1970 to date. January 15: a day to reaffirm the beauty, sophistication, and strength in our diversity, not merely a day for an annual celebration of military personnel.
