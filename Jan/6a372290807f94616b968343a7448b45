ISTANBUL, TURKEY – OCTOBER 19: Oghenekaro Etebo (13) of Galatasaray leaves the pitch after receiving red card during Turkish Super Lig week 5 match between Galatasaray and Aytemiz Alanyaspor at Turk Telekom Stadium on October 19, 2020 in Istanbul, Turkey.

Ivory Coast international Seri was previously on loan with Galatasaray last season but has been omitted from Fulham’s 25-man Premier League squad, meaning he has made just two cup appearances for Scott Parker’s side since his return from Turkey. Etebo, who is only due back in England in June after leaving the bet365 Stadium in September on a season-long loan, has struggled to live up to expectations in Turkey and has only made five appearances in all competitions for the Turkish club, including three starts in the Super Lig under coach Fatih Terim. As a result, the Cimbom coach does not see Etebo playing a major part in his plans going forward in the current campaign and Galatasaray are preparing to cut his loan stint short this month and are keen on a reunion with Seri. According to reports from Turkish news outlets Sabah and Hurriyet, Fulham are demanding €500,000 to allow Seri to return to Galatasaray on loan, and as a result, the Turkish giants are now set to terminate Etebo’s loan deal in order to ensure that can happen. Etebo, who spent the second half of last season on loan in Spain with Getafe, joined Stoke back in the summer of 2018 and has gone on to make 51 appearances in all competitions for the Potters, scoring twice.
