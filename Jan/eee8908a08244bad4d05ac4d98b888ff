• Police arrest 13 in fresh operations There is palpable fear by road users in Lagos over the upsurge in the operation of traffic robbers who have taken advantage of gridlock caused by road construction workers and tanker drivers along major routes.
 
Chief among the roads where the hoodlums operate are on top of the Apongbon Road bridge, Ikorodu Road, Oshodi-Anthony axis, Oshodi-Isolo expressway, and Mile 2-Ojo expressways, among others.
 
Irrespective of the time of the day, hoodlums have now taken it as a daily activity to attack vehicles and rob the occupants of their belongings. Only a few are often lucky to escape unhurt without losing any valuables whenever they strike.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
