Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has approved the engagement of 40 additional doctors for hospitals in Maiduguri and Jere councils. The newly recruited doctors are also to run hospitals in communities affected by the over decade-long insurgency that claimed many lives and property. Zulum gave the directives at the weekend, at a meeting with Chief Medical Directors (CMDs) of seven hospitals at Government House, Maiduguri. He said: “The engagement of more doctors in the hospitals, was to ensure qualitative service delivery to our people living in various communities. “In the past, the state government had approved the recruitment of 594 health workers, among them, 86 medical doctors, 365 nurses and midwives. “These include the employment of 45 pharmacists and 100 health technicians and other support staff.” While inspecting the state’s Specialist hospital, Maiduguri, the governor also directed the construction of an additional ward to address overcrowding in the wards.
