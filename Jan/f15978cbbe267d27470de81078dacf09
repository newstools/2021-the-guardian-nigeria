Residents lament cultists’ clashes, killings in Lagos
A man, Monsuru Aderoju, has been kidnapped in Igangan area of Ibarapa a day after Mrs Sherifat Adisa, owner of Subawah Petroleum in the area, was gruesomely murdered after she was abducted by yet-to-be identified gunmen.
 
Oladokun Oladiran, convener of an advocacy group named Igangan Development Advocates, confirmed the latest incident to journalists yesterday.
 
Aderoju, a cassava dealer popularly known as Alhaji Monsuru, was trailed to his home at Oke-Agbède, Igangan, where he was kidnapped on Monday evening.  MEANWHILE, at least two persons were feared killed on Sunday night in a clash between two rival cults, Aiye and Eiye confraternities, in the Igbogbo-Bayeku area of Ikorodu, Lagos State.
 
It was gathered that the fight broke out around 7:00p.m. after one of the rival groups stormed the community bus stop, where members of the other group were having a party. The fight led to the shooting of a member of one of the groups, which led to a reprisal.
 
According to eyewitnesses, one of the groups went away with the body of their member, while the other body was lying in front of the Community Secondary School.
 
A source said residents had fled the area as a result of the clash. “There is apprehension at Macaulay and Community down to Ilado. We call on the police to come to our rescue because residents are living in fear.”
 
This is just as residents of Mile 12 have also lamented that their lives are being threatened due to the activities of cult members in the area.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
