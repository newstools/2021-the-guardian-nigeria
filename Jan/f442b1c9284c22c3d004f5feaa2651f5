Telecommunications operators have said that they have been granted permission to carry out SIM replacement upon verification of the customer’s National Identity Number (NIN). They stated this while giving an update on their engagement with the Federal Government, This means that subscribers can get new SIM cards or replace lost ones upon presentation and confirmation of their valid NIN. The service providers under the aegis of Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) made this known in a statement signed by the Chairman and Publicity Secretary, Gbenga Adebayo and Damian Udeh respectively. The statement reads: “We note the challenges experienced by customers seeking to replace or upgrade their SIM cards following the suspension of sale and activation of SIM cards by the government which also affected SIM replacement. “We empathize with people who have been unable to reactivate their phone lines as a result of the suspension. “Further to engagements with the government on the matter, we are pleased to report that our members have been granted permission to carry out SIM replacement upon verification of the customer’s NIN. In this regard, our members are working with NIMC to ensure seamless system connectivity for verification of NINs.” ALTON, therefore, sought the continued patience and understanding of subscribers as telcos work with all stakeholders to resolve issues affecting SIM registration/swap and activation. The body assures telephone users of restoration of normal services in a seamless and effective manner as soon as possible.
