Okoro said that the Ebonyi Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, through the Veterinary Services Department, initiated the programme to control animal-mediated rabies. “During our World Rabies Week in 2020, we recorded a huge success in mobiliising dogs for mass deworming. “Though we did not do rabies campaign, we did mass deworming to raise consciousness about rabies among the residents. “Our major challenges is support and facilities. A lot of activities we carried out were sponsored by members of the committee. “We need refrigerators, backup power generating sets for the zones, and a central cool chain system for the state,” he said. The veterinary doctor said that the committee had been able to create structures and links with communities for easier communication and sensitisation. He said that the COVID-19 pandemic stopped activities that would have been carried out in 2020. Okoro appealed for the provision of adequate cool chain facilities for storing vaccines.
