At least, four persons were burnt beyond recognition, while seven cars and five motorcycles were destroyed yesterday when a petrol tanker crashed in Abeokuta, Ogun State. About 12 persons who sustained injury in the accident were rushed to the hospital, where they are currently receiving medical treatment. Residents, traders and travellers scampered for safety, as the impact of the inferno was weighty. The charred remains of a motorcyclist caught in the fire, which stood affixed to his motorcycle, drew tears uncontrollably from sympathisers, as affected taxi drivers who managed to escape broke down in tears. Though the Ogun State Fire Service officials got to the scene and eventually succeeded in putting out the fire, they could not save those who lost their lives. For hours, the area was cordoned-off, a development that led to heavy traffic gridlock around the busy area. The Guardian learnt that the incident, which occurred at about 7:50a.m., caused by a 33,000-litre tanker, involved nine casualties. According to eyewitness accounts, the tanker was coming from NNPC-Oke Mosan road axis, on the Presidential Boulevard, Kobape road, Kuto and took the overhead bridge, but while descending from the bridge, the tanker lost control due to failed break. It was learnt that the tanker went into flames after hitting a motorcycle from behind and later hit some of the cabs waiting for passengers by the bridge edge.	The development led to confusion as the incident happened near a private school and a bank facility. Parents were seen rushing to the school to get their children, while those in the bank fled the scene. There were, however, conflicting casualty figures. While some said three died, others said four, while some said the figure had risen as of the time of filing the report. The Commissioner for Special Duties, Mr Femi Ogunbanwo, who visited the scene, said the rescued victims had been taken to the hospital. While noting that all the medical expenses would be taken care of by the state government, he assured that investigation was ongoing on the cause of the incident to avert future reoccurrence.
