Father undergoes surgery after an encounter with suspected gunmen Following the ambush against Bauchi State Auditor-General, Abdu Usman Aliyu and his family by suspected kidnappers, his son, 25-year-old Zilkifiru Mohammed, has returned home after escaping from the kidnappers. Mohammed, who was kidnapped on Saturday evening alongside his father’s friend, Iliyasu Suleiman, on the Bauchi-Tafawa Balewa expressway after the auditor-general was shot in the face, reportedly escaped in the early hours of Sunday morning while the kidnappers were sleeping. According to a friend of the auditor-general’s son, who preferred not to be mentioned, Mohammed could not escape with his father’s friend because of his old age and the beating he got from the kidnappers. He said the kidnapped victim found his way to a police station from where he called his family to inform them of his location. The spokesman of Bauchi State Police Command, DSP Ahmed Wakili, had earlier confirmed the incident, saying that the police was on the trail of the kidnappers, while also requesting the public to come forward with information that could help in the arrest of the kidnappers and release of their victim. One of the three daughters of Aliyu, who was in the car when the attack happened, said they were in a state of confusion, but disclosed that the kidnappers had established contact, demanding an N30-million ransom. The auditor-general is billed to undergo surgery as soon as possible at an undisclosed hospital. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
