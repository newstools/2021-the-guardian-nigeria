A telecommunication service provider, Airtel, has commenced the National Identity Number (NIN) registration exercise in its retail outlets across the country. Airtel, in a statement yesterday in Lagos, said it was following an approval from the Federal Government, which granted it a verification and enrolment licence. The telco said that while selected retail outlets in Lagos and Abuja were now fully operational to register Nigerians for the NIN exercise, it had planned to expand its NIN footprints to cover more areas and states. It added that residents of Abuja could now visit Transcorp Hilton situated in Mataima or Airtel showrooms at Carpet Plaza and Aminu Kano Crescent in Wuse 2 while those in Lagos could walk into Airtel Express Point, Oyin Jolayemi, Victoria Island or Airtel showroom in Adeniran Ogunsanya, Surulere, Lagos. It said that Lagos residents could also visit the Airtel showroom in Tejuosho, Yaba; Isheri Road, Ogba and the Airtel showroom in Oba Akran, Ikeja to register for the NIN exercise. Chief Executive Officer, Airtel Nigeria, Segun Ogunsanya, who spoke on the new development, commended the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, for expanding the NIN registration outlets. Meanwhile, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in Lagos State has urged all physically-challenged applicants for the NIN to remain calm and shun unruly behaviours at NIMC offices. NIMC Lagos West Co-ordinator, Olumide Aremu, made the appeal following the protest by People Living with Disabilities (PLWD) at NIMC office earlier in the week. Aremu, who said that although NIMC gave priority to PLWD, nursing mothers and elderly people in enrolment, it should not be seen as a licence to be rude and disorderly whenever they arrived at NIMC offices for registration.
