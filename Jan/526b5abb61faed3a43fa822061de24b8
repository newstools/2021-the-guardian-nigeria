Rebic and Krunic’s absence is a blow for Stefano Pioli’s Milan who is already hit by injuries including forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic with midfielder Sandro Tonali suspended. AC Milan have a one-point lead on city rivals Inter in Serie A, with Juventus 10 points adrift of the leaders in fifth, having played a game less.
