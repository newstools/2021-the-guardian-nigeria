A multi-million naira trust fund to fight against gender-based violence (GBV) has been launched by an international non-governmental organisation, Jose Foundation.   
 
In a statement yesterday, President of the foundation, Dr Martins Abhulimhen, said the trust fund became necessary to address the rising cases of GBV across the country by providing guards against the menace.
 
He said the trust fund would create a “Centre of Expertise” that will bring together cyber sleuths, detectives and academics to tackle the scourge of sexual abuse in Nigeria.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
