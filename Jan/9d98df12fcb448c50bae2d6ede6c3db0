The President of the Nigeria Golf Federation, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, will turn 70 on February 3, and expectedly, golf captains of clubs across the country are already falling over one another to honour him with a birthday tourney. At once, two tourneys, one at the Miccom Golf Club, Ada, and another at the Ibadan Golf Club are already on the card to honour the grand birthday celebration of the former Governor of Lagos and Osun States. The tourney at Ada will hold on Sunday, February 6, while the Ibadan game is billed for Saturday, February 13. However, words from the celebrant indicates that another event could hold at the IBB golf Club in Abuja immediately after the Ibadan show.Expectedly, both the Ibadan and Ada games are fully booked with over 350 golfers from across the country attending each of the events. It is also gathered that invited professionals could feature in both Ada and Ibadan games. Prince Oyinlola has since expressed gratitude over intentions of Club captains to honour him with a birthday tourney. He reasoned that the captains did not show such interest just because he is the President of the Golf Federation, but they did because they cherished absolute friendship he had shared with golfers across the country over the years. Oyinlola said: “I keep saying that we don’t play golf just because we want play, but we play because the game affords us room to share absolute friendship and camaraderie. This is evident in the manner several tourneys came up to honour my day. I indeed thank all golfers.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
