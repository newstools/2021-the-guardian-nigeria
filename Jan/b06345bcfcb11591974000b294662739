Women In Energy Network (WIEN) are asking for 35% affirmative action to be applicable in the appointment of governing boards in the energy sector. WIEN is an association established in 2020 to provide a platform for Women that work across the energy industry value chain to network and build confidence and links to progress their careers and businesses. The president of WIEN and managing director of Zigma Limited Funmi Ogbue spoke at the Public Hearing on Petroleum Industry Bill ( PIB) 2020, organised by Senate’s joint Committee on Petroleum Downstream, Upstream and Gas on Thursday. She indicated that from research, boards of directors with at least three women demonstrate improved communications, greater adherence to codes of conduct, and better criteria for managing strategy and monitoring its implementation. “WIEN would like to see the deliberate inclusion of policies that will ensure that at least 35% of each Governing Board is constituted by women,” Funmi said. “WIEN suggest that the PIB mandates the inclusion of a minimum indigenous women from the Host Community on the Board of Trustees.” She kicked against the use of Gender Neutral Pronouns/Terms such as the PIB’s use of masculine terms – him, his, he to refer to the position of “Minister, Commissioner Chief Executive, Executive Commissioner, Non-Executive Commissioner, Authority Chief Executive, Executive Director, Directors and Officers of the Authority , Transaction Advisor, Licensee of the Petroleum Exploration Licence, Receiver, Liquidator.” According to her, such gender terms should be changed to gender neutral terms “they, their, its, a person.” “This is to avoid legal issues and confusion as in some other positions gender neutral terms are used,” Funmi said.
