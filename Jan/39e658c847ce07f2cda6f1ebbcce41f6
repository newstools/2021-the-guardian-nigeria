French police broke up a warehouse orgy involving a hundred people last night in Paris because it breached Covid-19 regulations. Officers raided the love-in at Collegien, a Paris suburb, on Friday night following reports of men and women meeting for the so-called ‘libertine’ party. According to France Bleu, the participants in the orgy were slapped with fines for non-compliance with the curfew aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 which is currently in effect across France. “The event was in breach of the curfew, and there were also problems with masks and social distancing,” said an investigating source. “Those involved in the libertine party cooperated with the police, and there was no resistance to the police.” Three people – believed to be organisers – were arrested soon after the 9 pm raid. Local magistrates sitting in an emergency session granted permission for sound and lighting equipment to be confiscated, along with alcohol. It was also recommended that attendees were provided with basic sex education as it relates to the spread of viruses. Orgies between consenting adults are legal in France, but the chance of contracting Covid-19 from an infected person during sex is almost guaranteed, Daily Mail reported. Coronavirus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, so kissing someone infected with it is a massive risk. Warehouse orgies generally involved people swapping partners, or turning up alone to find new ones, so the dangers are multiplied. France is currently experiencing up to 20,000 new cases of Coronavirus every day, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to contemplate a third lockdown. Read More:
