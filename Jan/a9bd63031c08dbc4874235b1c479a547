However, analysts expressed optimism that positioning for the full year 2020 dividends would continue to support positive sentiment amid negative real returns in the fixed income market. Analysts at Vertiva Dealing and Brokerage firms said: “In spite of the dominance of the bulls for most of the sessions during the week (evidenced by gains in three of the five trading sessions, and bullish sectroral performances), the index ended the week lower amidst significant declines in the Industrial goods sector. “We expect a recovery in the coming week, as the current price drop in the Industrial goods sector is expected to drive some buying interest in that region. Also, we anticipate some more positive patronage in the oil and gas sector as we continue to see improvement in the prices of crude oil,” they said. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “We do not rule out intermittent profit-taking. However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” A look at the market performance last week showed that transactions on the equity sector of the NSE reopened the year on a positive note on Monday, as market capitalisation appreciated by N458 billion.
