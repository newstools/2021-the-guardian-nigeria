 Nigerian Stock Exchange  At the close of trading, the ASI plunged by 48.57 points, representing a decrease of 0.12 per cent to close at 41,099.15 points. Also, market capitalisation depreciated by N26 billion to close at N21.499 trillion. The downtrend was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; MRS Oil Nigeria, Cadbury Nigeria, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Dangote Cement and Guinness Nigeria. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “With losses recorded in all sectors, except for the Industrial goods sector which benefited from the 547bps rise in the share price of WAPCO, the ASI was unable to sustain yesterday’s gain. “We expect tomorrow’s session to be mixed as continued bargain hunting is anticipated in some fundamentally sound names, while an extension of profit-taking action is expected in others (especially in the Insurance sector given recent rally).” Market sentiment, as measured by the market breadth, closed negative as 50 stocks lost, relative to 14 gainers.
