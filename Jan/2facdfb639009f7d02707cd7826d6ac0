Hospital squatting A Chinese family recently agreed to move out of a Beijing hospital after staying there for six years due to a financial dispute with the medical institution. The family came in contact with the hospital in 2014 when a man surnamed Tian was admitted there with symptoms that included nausea, vomiting and unsteady gait. He came to the hospital accompanied by his parents with complaints of nausea and vomiting for two months. When the time came for him to be discharged, Tian learned that he had to pay for his stay, so he accused the hospital of administering him an inappropriate treatment and refused to leave. The family then turned Tian’s hospital room into their home, bringing in pots and pans and filling the place with groceries and other personal belongings.
