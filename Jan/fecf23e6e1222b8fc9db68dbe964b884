Accordingly, investors lost N39 billion in value as market capitalisation depreciated to N21.491 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capital stocks, including Dangote Cement, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria, NASCON Allied Industries, and FBN Holdings (FBNH). Analysts at United Capital Plc said: “While we expect investors to book some profit from last week’s gains, demand for high-yield dividend companies should sustain the market’s bullish momentum.”
Afrinvest Limited said: “In the next trading session, we expect to see investors take profit. However, we are optimistic that the market will close on a positive note this week.” Also, analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “Despite the positive market breadth and the positive sectoral performances, the domestic market ended today’s session in the red, as a result of profit taking action in the Consumer goods and Industrial goods sectors. “With the rising inflation rate and the low yield in the fixed income market, we expect investors’ to continue to channel funds into the equity market in anticipation of a better return.” However, sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive, as 35 stocks gained, relative to 22 losers.
