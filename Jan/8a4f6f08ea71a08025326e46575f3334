Committed to transform agricultural and food production in Kano, the State Agro Pastoral Development Project (KSADP) has approved the contract for renovation of Watari irrigation scheme worth N314, 454, 625.
 
The irrigation scheme is situated downstream of the Watari Dam, in Bagwai Local Government area of Kano State, with potential to enhance cultivation of vast hectares of rice, several other crops and vegetables.
  
Speaking during the official handing over of the project to Hajaig Nigeria Ltd., the State Project Coordinator, Mallam Ibrahim Garba Muhammad, explained that the scope of work included repairs of gully erosion on the dam’s embankment, repairs and desilting of main canals and drainages, as well as the night storage reservoir.  It is expected that the governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, would flag-off the renovation work in the next couple of days.
 
A release signed by Project Communication Specialist, Ameen K. Yassar, stated that the dam and its auxiliary infrastructure had not undergone repairs in the last 40 years of creation despite its huge potential for agriculture and rural development.
