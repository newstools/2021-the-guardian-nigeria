Racist Football Manager Sacked After Disturbing Comments Surfaced Online A football manager has been sacked after “grotesque” footage of him appearing to make a shocking racist diatribe went viral. Jake Henderson posted a video showing himself appearing to make racist remarks as Home Secretary Priti Patel delivered a Covid update on TV. A woman is seen in the background. Henderson, whose former employers have also condemned his actions, was appeared to be shown saying: As a white man, I won’t be listening to people of colour because they’re no good in positions of power. The video then appears to show him make a string of shameful comments. After the video was widely shared and he was identified, he said he had lost his job and said his family was on the verge of disowning him. However, a note on his Instagram page also said: “I stand by what I said but I’m sorry.” In response, the Sunday league team he managed, Polo Pukz FC, said it was cutting its ties with him. The club, from Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said in a Tweet: Polo Pukz FC can announce Jake Henderson has been relieved of his managerial duties. We would like to assure everyone that his views in NO way represent our club and would like to thank everyone who brought this to our attention. A now-deleted LinkedIn page of Henderson’s said he worked at Stoneacre Motor Group. However, in a statement, the company said: It has been brought to our attention that an individual has posted comments that Stoneacre considers to be an act of hate crime and of serious distaste. We would like to reassure the public and our loyal customers that this individual is not currently employed by Stoneacre and hasn’t been for some time. The Board of Directors are happy to support the authorities should they seek our assistance. We want to offer our deepest apologies to all concerned. The video of Henderson’s terrifying outburst sparked a furious reaction on social media as reported by The Mirror.
