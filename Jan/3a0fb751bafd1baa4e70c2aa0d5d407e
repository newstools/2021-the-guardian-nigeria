Experts have called on the three tiers of government in the country and other critical stakeholders to work on improving the well-being of people living with disabilities.
   
Convener, Speaking Fingers Network, Treasure Uchegbu, said this during the celebration of International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) recently, with the theme “Building Back Better: Towards a Disability-Inclusive, Accessible and Sustainable post-COVID-19 World”.
    
Uchegbu, who maintained that no one should be left behind, said when the mind is liberated through good education; the blind will see and the deaf will hear, and with sign language; everyone is included as mental health is mental wealth.
