The Borno State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has applauded Governor Babagana Zulum for clearing pension arrears owed 4,862 retirees.
 
According to NLC, the cleared pensions cover from 2013 to 2017. Chairman, Borno State State’s NLC, Comrade Bulama Abiso, said: “We convey our sincere appreciations on behalf of all the retirees in the state. You have taken such a bold step to clear the backlogs of gratuities of 4,863 retired workers from 2013 to 2017.”
 
The Governor recently in Maiduguri, released N12 billion to offset the pension arrears of retired workers’ gratuities and pensions.
 
Abiso commended the Zulum and called on him to extend the gesture to state civil servants who are owed leave, transport and promotion allowances.
 
He noted that payment of gratuities would put smiles on the faces of retirees and their families.
 
“The payment of pensions to retirees comes at a critical time of recession,” he said, noting that it is an inspiration to present and future generations. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
