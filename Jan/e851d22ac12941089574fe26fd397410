The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit known as Taskforce said it has obtained a court order for a public auction of 88 one-way vehicles forfeited by Lagos State Mobile Court. Chairman of the Agency, CSP Shola Jejeloye disclosed that the vehicles to be auctioned by the government were impounded by the enforcement team of the Agency for driving against traffic laws at different parts of the state. “They were all arraigned and forfeited by court in line with Part (3) item (27) of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reformed Law of 2018,” Jejeloye said. Jejeloye confirmed that the public auction would hold in line with COVID-19 protocols on Wednesday, 20th of January, 2021 at the Agency’s Car Park, Behind Shoprite, Alausa, Ikeja. He urged motorists both private and commercial bus drivers to desists from driving against traffic rules as the penalty is an outright forfeiture of such vehicle to the government without any option of any fine. While reiterating the state government’s zero-tolerance for the violation of the law under any guise, the chairman confirmed that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police CP Hakeem Odumosu has directed the operatives of the agency to continue prosecuting traffic offenders until sanity is restored on our roads and law-abiding citizens are allowed to commute without being impeded by unlawful individuals. Meanwhile, the coordinator of the Lagos State Mobile Court Arinola Ogbara Banjoko confirmed that owners and drivers of these 88 court forfeited vehicles were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Micheal Olubi, Magistrate Lateef Layeni, Magistrate Oyebimbola Israel Adelakun, Magistrate Ibidun Abina and Magistrate Shakirat Obasa. She hinted that other traffic offenders caught plying BRT corridors or those causing obstructions to other road users were also arraigned and fined by Lagos State Mobile Court at Bolade, Oshodi.
