Senior Executive Director, Valency Group, Mr. Sumit Jain, in a statement, said engagement of 1,000 women workforce in its cashew production and processing factory, was a demonstration of the firm’s sensitivity to gender empowerment. He said: “In view of the expansion of production and processing of cashew nuts and other agro products, three peeling centres have been built and fully-equipped with the state-of-art modern processing machineries in Ibafo and Abule-oshun areas of Ogun State. “This, automatically, implied the need to increase the labour workforce by 400 female employees in addition to the existing 600 and also empower them with the skills, especially now due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. We have remained resolute in our commitment to enhance the enterprise value for shareholders and stakeholders, which implies sustaining the people’s wellbeing.” One of the beneficiaries, Rosemary Ibiam, a packaging operator, thanked the management for the opportunity.
