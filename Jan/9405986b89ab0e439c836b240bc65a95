The 21-kilometre Ijesha marathon has been scheduled for April 3. The race powered by BELTIJ limited, is expected to create a platform for long distance athletes in Osun State and its environs to showcase their potential. It has also received the nod of Athletics Federations of Nigeria (AFN). The event, which is expected to put Ijeshaland on a sports light, is the brainchild of Mr. Tijani Remilekun Usman, who is the Chief Executive Officer of BELTIJ limited located on kilometer 3, Ilesa/Akure Expressway, Iwaraja, Ilesa. The firm is sponsoring the road race in conjunction with Unique FM and Freedom TV Ilesha. Usman said he decided to sponsor the event in order to take youths out of streets and redirect their focus from cyber crimes to good things sports can offer. “We want to use the race to engage the youths and build professional athletes that will represent Nigeria in international athletics events. Most of our youths now occupy themselves with unproductive activities like illicit drugs-taking, cultism, violence practices, juvenile delinquency and other social vices. I believe they can be positively engaged in healthy sporting activities that can enhance their future. I decided to bring my company to Ilesa with the view to provide employment opportunities for the youths,” he stated.
