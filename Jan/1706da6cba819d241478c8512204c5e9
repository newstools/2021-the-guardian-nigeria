Thrilled by the fireworks displayed by the two boxers that fought for the vacant World Boxing Federations (WBF) Super Featherweight belt in Ibadan last weekend, the president of the body, Howard Goldberg, has nominated the bout before his board as the best in 2020. The WBF Fight of the Year according to the information posted on the official website of the boxing body, took place on Sunday, December 27, headlining an open-air show in Ibadan, Nigeria. “Granted, there have been fewer fights to pick from in 2020, but this one would have been a top contender in any year,” it said. With a loud crowd on their feet celebrating the entertainment, Ridwan “Scorpion” Oyekola fought tooth and nail with an Argentine opponent, Lucas Matias Montesino, to capture the vacant World Boxing Federation (WBF) International Super Featherweight title. Oyekola scored a knock-down in the second round, but a tough-as-they-come Montesino beat the count of referee Eddie Marshal and came back strong, often giving as good as he got, making almost every round close and hard to decide. Meanwhile, the Presidency, according to the Chairman of the Local Organising Committee of the event, Sir Olawale Okunniyi, would soon announce a date to receive the boxer and the members of the LOC in the villa. Okunniyi, while speaking with newsmen in Ibadan after receiving a congratulatory message from President Muhammadu Buhari, said the arrangement was on-going by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, to communicate the date to the LOC. The President on Tuesday congratulated the new World Boxing Federation International Super Featherweight champion, Ridwan Oyekola, known as ‘Scorpion’ on his victory. His congratulatory message was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, entitled “President Buhari congratulates new boxing champion, Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
