Youths seek cancellation of election, threaten suit The election of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Owerri, Imo State last weekend that threw up former diplomat, Prof. George Obiozor as the President-General means nothing, a rival group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly (ONGA) Worldwide, has stated. Reacting to Obiozor’s emergence, the assembly’s President-General (PG), Basil Onyeachonam Onuora, told The Guardian in a telephone interview that “any election purported to have held and produced Obiozor as the PG was a kangaroo election.” According to Onuora, the “activities of the defeated Nwodo-led Ohanaeze Ndigbo were illegal as he led a non-existent body and his purported tenure as PG was a nullity.” The lawyer advised Obiozor “to go home and rest, as there is no leadership vacuum in Ohanaeze Ndigbo.” ALSO yesterday, past youth leaders have rejected last weekend’s election that produced Obiozor as new president general. Rising from a meeting in Enugu, they threatened court action if the exercise is not cancelled in the next two days. Briefing reporters after the meeting, leader of the group, Ndubuisi Igwekala, stated that it had never been in the history of the association that serving governors and political leaders allegedly voted in its elections.
