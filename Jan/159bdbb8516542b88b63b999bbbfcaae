Members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers under OPEC+, yesterday, agreed to cap crude production at current levels in February. The decision was taken at the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) meeting.
   
In December, the partners agreed to raise collective output quotas by 482,000 b/d for January from the 7.68 million b/d that was based largely on October 2018 baselines.
   
Having agreed to raise quotas by 500,000 b/d for January – a compromise between members, despite uncertainty about pandemic recovery, the cartel decided to maintain the conservative quotas next month over demand concerns.
   
The market, however, reacted to the news as Brent Crude dropped from the $52.43 it recorded earlier in the day to $51.12 as at 5:57 pm WAT while Nigeria’s Bonny light slipped by 0.45 per cent to $50.59 per barrel.
