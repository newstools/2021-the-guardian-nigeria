He said from the body language of the Nigerians, it is obvious that they are not satisfied with what is on ground, adding that there is urgent need for regrouping of the ‘good politicians’ to restore public confidence in governance and save the country. Okorocha, who is also the aenator representing Imo West, recently stirred controversy when he called for the good people in APC and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to come together and rescue Nigeria in 2023, while commissioning projects in Rivers State, at the instance of the State governor, Nyesom Wike. The former insisted that the country needs political reengineering, warning that Nigerians cannot be fooled again by mischievous politicians in 2023. According to him, “the movement for a new Nigeria has begun and we must come together, I mean progressive Nigerians to make the country work. Queried if the promise of the new political movement for a new Nigeria will not be akin to that of the APC in 2015, Okorocha, retorted that the APC was hurriedly formed to take power the PDP without much emphasis on the character of those championing the course. He assured that the political coalition is being championed by people with a proven track record of achievement and public spirit, noting that it is no more ideal to allow people who do not have genuine love for the unity and progress of the country to hijack power. He said, “APC was a hurried arrangement, it was hurriedly formed to take power when the then government was drifting. APC would have been better until people who were not members of the party; people who came for congratulatory message hijacked the party and became Lords.
