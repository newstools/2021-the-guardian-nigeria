It was another tragic weekend in Taraba State, as gunmen gruesomely murdered the Chairman of Ardo-Kola Council, Salihu Dovo. The unknown gunmen reportedly killed the council boss in the early hours of yesterday, shortly after he was abducted from his Sabon-Geri residence in Jalingo. The gunmen, according to The Guardian findings, stormed his compound, which is directly opposite the police mobile barrack at about 1a.m. Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) in the state has urged security operatives to immediately commence investigation into the matter. Confirming the report to The Guardian, the ALGON chairman, Bala Bako, said: “We want security operatives to immediately carry out investigation and tell the public the circumstances surrounding his killing.” Bako, who described the killing as “a rude shock” urged the security outfits not to leave any stone unturned in unravelling the circumstances that led to his abduction and killing. The gunmen, The Guardian gathered, called an official of the council on phone to announce the killing of their victim, leading to speculations that assassins did the job. According to our source, after announcing the killing, the gunmen told an official of the council to go and search for the body in a nearby bush. “Members of the community immediately went into the bush and started searching for his body. It was found not long ago, and has been taken to town,” he said. Also confirming the gory incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, affirmed that Ardo-Kola was murdered in the early hours of yesterday, but could not explain if it was assassination. Misal added that the command would not rest until the perpetrators were fished out and prosecuted. Taraba, especially, Jalingo, the state capital, has recently been under siege, as kidnappers, assassins, armed bandits and other criminals have been.
