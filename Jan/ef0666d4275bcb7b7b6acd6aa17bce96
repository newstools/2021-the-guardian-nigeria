A Group, Oodua Action Movement (OAM), has insisted that there is need for a referendum to actualise the Yoruba nation’s autonomy. In a statement in Akure, yesterday, by its External Affairs Committee Chairman, Ayodele Ologunloluwa, the group said there would be a national conference for all Yoruba youths in Nigeria and in the Diaspora. He said the conference would determine, among other things, the actualisation of Yoruba nation’s autonomy without infringing on the rights of other ethic nationalities. Besides, the Global Co-ordinator of the group, Demola Edward, said the proposed conference would be one of its kinds in the history of the region. According to him, the conference will discuss the modalities to achieve the aims and objectives of the Yoruba nation’s autonomy. He enjoined all Yoruba groups in Nigeria and in the Diaspora that have genuine interest of the region in their heart to register with the External Affairs Co-ordinator of the OAM for proper planning. The Co-ordinator, who lauded Chief Sunday Igboho and Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for the quit notice given to Fulani herdsmen in Oyo and Ondo states, decried the invasion of Yorubaland by the herders. saying: “This is no longer the Nigeria of the dream of the founding-fathers. Since majority of Nigerians no longer have faith in being together again, the best solution is for people to go their different ways. But we have resolved not to do it in a chaotic manner. “The killing and kidnapping by the Fulani herdsmen in South-West must be stopped. Enough is enough.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
