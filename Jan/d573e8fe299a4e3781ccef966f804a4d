The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has denied allegation of bribery levelled against him. According to a statement signed yesterday by the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, was claimed to have offered Malami gratification in respect of the appointment of a sole administrator of the Niger Delta Development Commission. “The report, as any fake news, was marred by evincing contradictions, figment of imagination, sheer fabrications and filthy assumptions of mischief makers and detractors”, the statement read in part. “The AGF hereby makes an outright denial of the report in its entirety.  The Minister has not collected and does not intend at any time to receive any gratification from any dealing and discharging any function he is constitutionally empowered to perform.” While calling on Nigerians to disregard the information, Malami asked individuals who have any information regarding those who facilitated, accepted, deliver or take part in one way or the other in the alleged offer and purported acceptance of gratification for him or his office to come out publically with the information with a view to exposing them and taking further necessary action, saying gratification is a criminal offence. He accordingly encouraged the purveyors of the fictitious publication to approach relevant security and law enforcement agencies and proffer information that could lead to the investigation and investigation against him if they feel strongly about their claim.
