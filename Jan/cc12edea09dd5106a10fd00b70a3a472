The President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali, has said that the federation will go ahead with the hosting of the maiden edition of Champion of Champions Tournament amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The championship scheduled to commence tomorrow at the ultra-modern Theatre of Wrestling Complex, Yenizue Gene in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, will end on January 18. In a chat with The Guardian yesterday, Igali said that due to the more devastating effect of the pandemic that the federation had taken a decision to decrease the number of athletes participating in the championship. He added that all due protocols would be adhered to in collaboration with the Bayelsa Ministry of Health to avoid any breach of the rules put in place by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic. “The championships will go ahead as planned. We have reduced the number of athletes to just 55 due to rules guiding participation in halls to less than half of capacity in Bayelsa. “The hall in question can accommodate about 250 persons and we are not allowing spectators. Only accredited athletes and officials and journalists not exceeding 100 persons will be allowed into the hall,” he said. The World and Olympic gold medalist added that, “There will be 100 per cent COVID-19 compliance in consultation with the Commissioner and Ministry of Health of Bayelsa State. “All contingent to the Champion of Champions tournament will be tested a day before the tournament. There will be adequate spacing and observance of hand washing and masks. We are taking all due precautions,” he stated. The championship an initiative of the NWF’s boss is being organised to put the country’s ‘Olympic hopefuls’ in prime shape and be ready for the 2021 African Championships and Africa/Oceania Olympic qualifiers fixed for April in El Jadida, Morocco.
