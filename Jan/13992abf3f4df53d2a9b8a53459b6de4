 Kano state governor, Ganduje  Mr Muhammad Sanusi-Kiru, the state Commissioner of Education, gave the directive in Kano  while presenting Common Entrance Examination forms to zonal educational inspectors. According to him, all principals of boarding schools are expected to relocate to their respective school premises to ensure the security and safety of students. “I am directing all principals of boarding schools to relocate to their schools immediately or face sack. “Any principal that has issues with accommodation within the school should write to the ministry so that necessary measures can be taken. “It does not make sense that students are left in schools, while principals, who are the first officials to be contacted in case of any emergencies, are sleeping outside the schools. ” There is the need for all principals to be close to their students, especially at this critical moment of security challenges in the country. “I want to assure you that security agents will be deployed to the schools to monitor the principals. Anyone found wanting  would blame himself or herself,” the commissioner said. He gave assurance of the government’s commitment to ensuring that all schools are fenced, especially boarding schools, to ensure adequate security. Sanusi-Kiru also ordered immediate deployment of vigilantes across all boarding schools in the state to boost security and safety.
