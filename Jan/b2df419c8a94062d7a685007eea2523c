As Anyim inaugurates Rumuekini-Aluu road Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, yesterday, declared that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been justifying its failures with excuses in spite of the huge promises it made to Nigerians. He noted that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) knew that there were several challenges in the country and was resolving them with projects that impact citizens positively, especially in Rivers State. Wike, who restated that he would not leave the PDP, spoke during the inauguration of the Rumuekini-Aluu Road, traversing Obio/Akpor and Ikwerre councils performed by former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim. He reaffirmed that he would not burden his successor with uncompleted projects adding: “I will complete all projects awarded by my administration before the expiration of my tenure.” The governor explained that it was important to stress that his successor would initiate his own projects and not be burdened by inherited uncompleted projects. While unveiling the road project, Anyim said he was delighted to associate with Governor Wike because he had demonstrated through his projects that he was truly bonded with Rivers people and knew their needs. Anyim pointed out that it was this level of leadership that had enabled Wike to conceive projects tailored towards meeting those needs, and eliminate the possibility of having white elephant projects. “Because Governor Wike commissions projects, it is certain that no project will be abandoned. I am proud to identify with the progress you have made in Rivers State. “I am proud to belong to the PDP family. It is the spirit of PDP that is at work in your government and that spirit will eventually work for Nigeria. “When I was invited for the commissioning, I did not really appreciate the magnitude of the work and the real import of the governance Governor Wike has brought to Rivers State.” “But as we drove down here, the impression I have is that Port Harcourt has expanded. It is only the government of the people that can expand a city to the extent that Port Harcourt has expanded,” he stated. On his part, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi, said prior to its reconstruction, the Rumuekini-Aluu Road was a nightmare and that it took a negative toll on socio-economic activities of the people.
