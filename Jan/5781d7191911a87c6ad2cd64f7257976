Nigeria’s leading hair extension brand, Darling, is delighted to announce the winners of its “Style like a Star” campaign. The campaign, which ran at the end of last month, challenged consumers to create a 60 seconds video on Instagram with Darling hair extensions using 10 pre-selected Darling influencer’s hairstyles as a guide for a chance to win exciting prizes including cash, shopping vouchers, spa treatments and other treats. Aside from engaging with its thousands of followers on Instagram, the campaign was also a way to showcase customers’ creativity and of course reward them. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1314981 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="801" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling.jpg 660w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling-487x305.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling-320x200.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling-640x400.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Darling-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Speaking about the campaign and its outcome, Ayodele Otujinrin, Marketing Lead, West Africa, Godrej said, “The aim of the campaign was to celebrate the creativity of our amazing customers and also appreciate them, but we thought it’d be more engaging to do something that was fun and exciting, hence the #StyleLikeAStar campaign. We’re extremely pleased with the uptake as we got a record number of creative videos shared by consumers. We’ll continue to push and ensure that we bring more products that meet our customers’ needs and expectations so that they can continue to express their style however they choose”, she concluded. The winner of the campaign went home with N100, 000 in cash, a N50,000 voucher valid for six months on the Godrej e-commerce store, and a star treatment for two with Darling extensions from a partner stylist.
