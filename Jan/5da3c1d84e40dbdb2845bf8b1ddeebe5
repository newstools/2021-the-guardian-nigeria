 [FILES] Kano-Pillars  The Port Harcourt based side coming out of a successful 5-0 aggregate thrashing of South Africa’s Bloemfontein Celtic, will want to continue their good run of form against a formidable Pillars, who are playing at home. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Rivers United’s Head Coach, Stanley Eguma, said that the duel would be a big matchup. “Tomorrow’s game is one of those other league matches, but it is going to be a big one. Kano Pillar is a very good team. This season, they played in the CAF Confederation Cup. “I see them as a very good side, and they are also doing well in the league. We respect them because they have won the league on several occasions in the past. But this term, we’re also contending for the league title, and we have to give our best to make a statement. “We know that the match is an important one and our players need to be up and doing. We need to turn our focus back to the league after our successful outing in the Confederation Cup. We hope to give our best against Pillars. Earning points is very important from this game, and we know that our hosts will also come out very strongly to contest the points. It is definitely going to be an interesting game playing Pillars at this point,” he stated. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
