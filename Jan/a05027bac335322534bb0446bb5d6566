By Nigeria must change her relationship with prosperity. Wealth is everywhere you look: Japan that knows neither Jesus nor Mohammed; as well as South Korea, is in everlasting riches though she only knows the Buddha. China and Russia that know no God have conquered poverty. Transactions happen all the time. With our hypocrisy, we’re just on the wrong side of those transactions; always consuming, never producing. We don’t need a huge slice of the pie. We only need a tiny fraction of the seven billion people on earth to buy something we produce or manufacture. Let us do the mathematics: N100k a year gives N12 million when you have a business that sells products 24 hours a day. Sadly, we even import tooth picks produced from our wood and petrol mined from our soil. We are not planning for prosperity, never internalizing the Biblical aphorism that God blesses the work of your hands and not your person. We need only five years to build an industry that will liberate us from neocolonialism.
   
Only last December, the World Bank rated Nigeria the 26th largest economy in the world and 24th for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). However, these two measures represent different aspects of the economy. While GDP is the measure of the market value of goods and services produced in a country in a year, the PPP reflects the purchasing power of Nigerians in Naira and the standard of living of the people. As at December 2020, the World Bank also estimates that 46 percent or 91 million Nigerians are poor while another 19 million are vulnerable to multi- dimensional poverty. This picture does diminish whatever cheer inspired by the World Bank ranking. In reference, multi-dimensional poverty means a state of abject poverty and deprivation beyond financial insolvency. With the bulk of Nigerians so trapped in debilitating poverty, it isn’t surprising Nigeria is in turmoil with resurgent kidnapping, banditry and Boko Haram insurgency. Thus, this escalating insecurity is traceable to the poor state of the economy.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
