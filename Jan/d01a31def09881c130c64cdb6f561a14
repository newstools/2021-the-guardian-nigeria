The ward secretaries should be responsible, know what they are doing and to always listen to the leadership of the party. Winning Ekiti back in 2022 is dear to our hearts in PDP and you have critical roles to play for us to actualise this.” The convener of the parley and former Commissioner for Works under ex-governor, Ayodele Fayose, Ogun, said she called the meeting in order to charge the ward and local council secretaries on how best to perform their duties as opposition party’s scribes.
