Taj Bank has reiterated its commitment to the growth and development of the Nigerian education sector. It made the commitment at the recent commissioning of new infrastructure undertaken by the bank as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) at the Saint John Paul School in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. A statement by its Head of Marketing Communications, Ms. Mariam Ehicheoya, said the ceremony attracted several dignitaries including the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Chairman of the school, Mrs. Uloma Akpabio and the Sole Administrator, the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Mr. Akwa Efiong. Akpabio commended the bank for believing in the vision of the school and accepting to provide financing for the expansion of its infrastructure. This, he said, was an indication of the bankâ€™s willingness to collaborate with credible bodies to improve the condition of earning in the country. Akpabio urged the bank to open a branch in Uyo as a priority once it secures national licence. Mr. Nasir Usman, who represented the bank, acknowledged the enormous strides the leadership of the school has made to provide quality education in the country. In just over one year of operation, Taj, a non-interest bank, has recorded several milestones. Recently, it won the Bank of the Year, an award conferred by Leadership Newspapers Group.
