 Cart Pusher  Oresanya called on them to cooperate with OGWAMA for the realisation of the new reforms, adding that anyone that fails to comply with the new order will be arrested and prosecuted in accordance with the Ogun State Environmental Laws.
 
On the scrap vendors, the Special Adviser frowned on their poor attitude of scattering bagged waste in search of iron scraps, warning them to desist from such act or face arrest, saying their operation will soon be regulated to meet environmentally-accepted standards.
 
Reacting, the leader of the Cart Pushers, Hassan Amidu, pledged his members’ cooperation while Prince Olatunde Okunowo of the Makogi CDA, who spoke on behalf of the CDAs, called on residents of communities to stop patronising cart-pushers and scrap vendors for the successful implementation of the new waste management reforms.
