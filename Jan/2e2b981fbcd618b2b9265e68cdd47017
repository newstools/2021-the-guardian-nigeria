He said no state chief executive had treated Ukwa indigenes this much, recalling that under Ikpeazu’s watch, another of their son, Asiforo Okere, is current state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Same for Sir Don Ubani (Deputy Chief of Staff); Prof. Maxwell Ogbulu (Vice-Chancellor, Abia State University (ABSU); and Wabara (Pro-Chancellor of the varsity). “This is unprecedented in the political history of the people of Ukwa,” the Senate ex-president observed. Describing Ukwa people as industrious, hardworking, trustworthy, and deserving of the governorship, Ikpeazu said that they had always distinguished themselves in public service from the time immemorial, saying this conviction informed his choice of picking them for key positions in his government. He stated: “I found great pleasure in marketing the candidature of Ambassador Okey Emuchay to my brother governors of the South East and other notable leaders because he possesses unassailable records of public service at the highest level in the country, having risen to the zenith of his diplomatic service.” Noting that beyond their natural endowments, Ukwa people have contributed greatly to the development of Abia State and Nigeria, the governor urged them to uphold their hard work and dignity in public service. He challenged the present crop of Ukwa leaders from Ndoki and Asa to continue to sustain the characteristics that had been associated with them over the years. Ikpeazu recalled exploits of the late Dr. Dick Emuchay, Chief Emma Adiele; Chief Lambert Nmecha; Dr. Eze Feyi Waboso; Eze (Dr.) Rowland Asobie; Dame Victoria Akanwa, Reginald Stanley, among others.
