An early morning fire razed the Ibadan home of Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho on Tuesday. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Sunday Igboho gained national popularity earlier in the month after issuing a seven-day ultimatum  to herders in Igangan, Ibarapa, Oyo State, to vacate the town. He accused the herders of being culpable in the strings of kidnappings and killings carried out in and around the town. At the expiration of the ultimatum, Igboho led a group of people who chased the herders out of Igangan. Igboho and his followers proceeded to eject the Fulani leader of Igangan, Salihu Abdukadir. He accused the Fulani leader of harbouring criminal herders who were kidnapping and killing residents of the community. Abdukadir denied the allegations, stating that some members of his community have also been victims of the attacks and kidnappings trailing  the community. Some houses and cars were burnt in the process of evicting Abdukadir from the community. The State’s governor, Seyi Makinde, while reacting to Igboho’s actions said his government would not allow anyone hiding under the guise of ethnic interest to perpetrate a crisis in the state. Makinde said the war to be waged by the state and the security agencies is against criminal elements, irrespective of their tribes, religions, or creed. He added that his administration would not allow anyone to threaten the peace of the state by acting unlawfully as such is against the nation’s Constitution.
