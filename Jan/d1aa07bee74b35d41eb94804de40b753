Commercial bus drivers, yesterday, protested around the Agege-Ogba-Berger axis of Lagos State against alleged extortion by officials of the Lagos State task force. The development left passengers stranded around the area.
 
The protesters barricaded the road at the popular Omole Junction, Ikeja, while some of them held weapons in a bid to resist further arrests. They also prevented drivers who attempted to convey passengers to their destinations from operating.
 
They alleged that the task force officials were making business unattractive for them and causing colossal losses.
 
The protesters also carried placards, with inscriptions such as: ‘We are not robbers, but commercial drivers’ and ‘Help LASG; Commercial bus drivers say no more task force.’  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
