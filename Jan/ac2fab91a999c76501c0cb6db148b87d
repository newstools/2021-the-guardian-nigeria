He reminded non-governmental organisations, corporate entities, religious leaders and faith institutions that the state government has laws prescribing the free and compulsory education of all children in properly registered schools. “The rights of the children described as almajirai to be treated with the dignity accorded all other children is a matter of fairness and equality of treatment that no responsible government should compromise. “Since March 2020, 31,092 almajiri children have been repatriated to their states of origin, when the Northern Governors Forum decided to jointly end the abuses associated with the Almajiri system…” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
