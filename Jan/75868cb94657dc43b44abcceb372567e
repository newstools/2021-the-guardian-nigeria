Photo: Completesports.com Golden Eaglets coach, Fatai Amoo, says he would submit programme for the African U-17 championship billed for Morocco in March to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) any moment from now. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Amoo said the Eaglets, who are currently on break after securing the AFCON ticket in the WAFU B championship in Lome, Togo, recently, had been instructed by the team doctors on the type of food to eat so as to remain fit for the AFCON championship. He stated that the team’s performance in Togo had given him an insight on how to prepare the boys ahead of the African championship. The coach hinted that quality preparation is needed to enable the Golden Eaglets conquer the rest of Africa when hostilities begin Morocco. Amoo enjoined football-loving Nigerians to keep encouraging the players to boost their morale. He said: “I will submit the AFCON programme soon to the NFF. At this point, the players are on break with their parents. The doctors have given them the basic routine on how to keep fit before we will regroup for the African championship. For now, I don’t think there is any need for me to invite new players in to the Golden Eaglets squad. The players we have are good enough to excel in Morocco.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
