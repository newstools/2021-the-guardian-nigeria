There is hope that hospitals experiencing shortage of oxygen will soon have a new source of supply as the Medical Director (MD) of the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Umuahia, Azubuike Onyebuchi disclosed to The Guardian yesterday while reacting to the reported shortage of oxygen in some parts of the country. Oxygen is said to be one of the crucial items used in managing Covid-19 patients in hospitals. Onyebuchi said his Center does not lack oxygen because it’s oxygen plant produces its needs and by end of this month when the plant’s production capacity normalizes as assured by the contractor, it will be in position to sell to outsiders. He said that they have recorded increased Covid-19 patients noting that the 50-bed capacity Isolation Center has been put to full use. He urged members of the public to adhere strictly and religiously to all prescribed Covid-19 preventive Protocols to avoid being infected. According to him, they have re-energized their sensitization campaigns insisting that all staff and visitors without face masks should be denied entry while hand washing spots are located strategically along with hand sanitizers in the hospital.
