Importers and exporters have continued to count losses to the inefficiencies at Nigerian seaports, as the Shippers’ Association Lagos State (SALS), estimated that operators lost an average of N2.8 trillion to irregular import procedures last year.
 
This is further compounded by inadequate infrastructure deficiency at the ports, and poor government policies.	The President, SALS, Jonathan Nicol, in a statement to The Guardian appealed to the Federal Government to restructure the import policies, and called for the review of the ports concession agreement to contain relieves for cargo owners.
 
Nichol said: “The Customs External Tariff has not been favourable to our country. It is one of the reasons why the border was shut. The overall total of shippers’ losses, forceful duty payments, demurrages and storage charges from Shipping and Terminal Operators, traffic menace put together is over N2.8 trillion on an average. If you remove N1.2 trillion or Customs, the balance of N1.6 trillion is a drop of water into an ocean of endless debts.  “Major investors have left the scene to other countries because their investments cannot be protected. Other African countries are glad to accommodate our traders in their countries. They deliberately reduce their Customs duty and tariffs to encourage trade. Why can’t we do the same in Nigeria?” he said.
   
Nicol said lack of infrastructure is doing more harm to businesses at seaports.  “Evacuation of empty containers out of our cities is still prevalent. Empty containers issues are now endemic, sapping container deposits from shippers in billions of naira. Terminal operators constantly charge demurrages against shippers for inability of trucks to access the ports, which is no fault of the shippers or importers.
   
“This is already affecting industries tremendously. Some factories fail to receive raw materials, when needed, even though all charges were paid. Additional demurrages increased by 22 per cent on cargo. Some industries may shut down in 2021 if something is not done to correct the situation, quickly,” Nicol. He also decried the frequent slamming of surcharge on Nigerian bound cargoes by the shipping companies, due to the infrastructure challenges at the seaports.
