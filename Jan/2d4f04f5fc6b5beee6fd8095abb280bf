  The advice is contained in a statement signed by its chairman, Dr Idayat Durotoye. Durotoye stated that the general guidelines for university staff and students on the prevention of COVID-19 required everyone to take preventive measures. “All staff and students on campus should not relent in observing preventive and control measures. “Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing, sneezing, or fever. “Maintain at least two metres distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing repeatedly,’’ she stated. Durotoye also urged people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water as the university had provided “Hand Wash Spots’’ and sanitisers across campuses. “It is compulsory to cover your mouth and nose with face masks, while on UniIlorin campuses to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Also ensure proper respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth or nose with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue paper properly immediately after use,’’ she advised. Durotoye also urged students and staff members with symptoms of fever, coughing, or sneezing not to mingle with people or congregate. According to her, people must obey national and state directives on good social distancing; they should work from home unless exempted or on essential duties. “Ensure that you wipe all surfaces in your offices including door handles, desks, tables, and TV remote controls among others with an alcohol-based sanitiser,’’ she added.
