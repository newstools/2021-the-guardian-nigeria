 [FILES] Senate President Ahmad Lawan PHOTO: Twitter  In a statement he personally signed in Abuja on Sunday, the nation’s third citizen also felicitated with the institution’s governing council for the rancour-free exercise. He said Waziri’s academic and leadership feats were an inspiration to women in the North and other parts of Nigeria to distinguish themselves in their chosen professions for national development. Lawan urged the appointee to remain exemplary by bringing her vast administrative and academic experiences to bear on working with the management and staff grounds. The Senate president added: “With the appointment of Professor Waziri, the governing council has sustained the steady sail of Federal University, Gushau towards becoming a true citadel of learning and research. “Professor Waziri has served with merit in three universities, including the Federal University, Gashua where she was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor until this new appointment. “Her credentials thus amply recommend her for this appointment and underscore the popular expectation that she will discharge the onerous tasks of the office with distinction.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
