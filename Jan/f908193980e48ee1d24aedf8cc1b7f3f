To drive infrastructure maintenance costs and emissions, the Lagos State government has commenced a retrofit project that would aid the replacement of all streetlights with smart LED lighting.
  
The project, already approved by the Lagos State Executive Council in furtherance of the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda of the administration, will see the state leveraging new technology for street lighting.
  
Following the completion of the pilot phase, the full implementation of the Streetlight Retrofit Project is expected to span six months with an expected project completion timeline put in June 2021. The project will be implemented under the close supervision and management of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources through the Lagos State Electricity Board.
