JIM WATSON / AFP Democrat Jon Ossoff clinched victory in the second Georgia Senate runoff, US networks projected Wednesday, guaranteeing his party control of the body. Ossoff defeated incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue with a nearly 25,000-vote margin, or 0.56 percent, with 98 percent of the expected vote counted, NBC and ABC projected. His win, after fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a parallel runoff election Tuesday, gave both parties 50 seats in the Senate. With the chamber evenly split, Democratic Vice-president elect Kamala Harris will play the role of the tie-breaker, giving Democrats control of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives.
