The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has said the nation should expect worse days in the New Year if the Federal Government does not initiate and implement good economic policies for growth and job creation.
 
The union in its New Year message said the present administration had forgotten the promised ‘change mantra’ to the populace, stating that the unemployment rate had tripled since government came into power in 2015.
 
President of TUC and Secretary General, Quadri Olaleye and Musa-Lawal Ozigi, respectively, maintained that Nigeria’s job crisis is caused by perennial under funding of some critical sectors, especially the education sector.
 
They queried that government had not shown any prudence and responsibility in the dubbed 2021 budget tagged, “Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience”.  “Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience”. This does not show prudence and responsibility.
Nigeria is our business and we must make it work. 
 
“To escape the club of houseboys’ roles we must stop accepting anything foreign as better and superior to ours? One of the lessons learned during the First World War was that the white people are not God. The Covid-19 has further shown that white people do not have solutions to all problems. The Congress expects that in 2021 the leadership must be patriotic enough to look inward and also stop taking away our resources to the land of our oppressors,” the statement added.
