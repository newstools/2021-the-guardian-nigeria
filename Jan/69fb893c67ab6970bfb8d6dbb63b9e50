Godwin Obaseki and other key stakeholders in the health sector. “We are very grateful to see the command that the governor has around the response and all that he is doing to support the activities of public health. “We want to keep the world out there around testing for COVID-19. We have seen a surge in cases of recent and we are encouraging the populace to come out and get tested,” he said. Igumbor added that the various laboratory facilities in the state had been visited, adding “we like the decentralised testing strategy that the state has adopted. “We just want to reinforce the strategy and communicate it to our colleagues, both at federal and state levels, to take a cue from what we have seen in Edo. “We hope that we will get more people tested so that we can use that a yardstick to determine the response level and control the pandemic in our communities,” he said.
