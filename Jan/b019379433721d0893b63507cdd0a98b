 Amotekun  Commercial activities were halted for hours in Mokola, Ibadan, Oyo State capital yesterday morning as some residents staged a peaceful protest against an operative of the Oyo State Security Network Agency, codenamed Amotekun, who killed a 23-year-old man, Tosin Thomas.
 
Commuters had hectic time passing through the commercial centre of the town as protesters blocked roads and condemned what they called unprofessional handling of arms by Amotekun operatives.
 
Thomas, it was gathered, was said to have engaged the Amotekun operative in a hot argument and in anger, the local security guard pulled the trigger and shot Tosin. Some residents who tried to prevail on the operative were threatened.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
