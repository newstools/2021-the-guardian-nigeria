Improved adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in business organisations will bring more value to organisations, AXA Mansard advised firms that want to achieve greater height. The Nigerian arm’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Data Officer, Ngozi Ola-Israel, who spoke along with nine speakers from three continents at its just-concluded Data Science Week 2020 Hackathon event, explained the firm’s productivity is stimulated by empowering the employees with relevant data analytics and machine learning skills needed to be effective in their daily task. Supported by Zindi Africa, the event is a challenge on data analytics opened to only AXA Mansard employees. The challenge, which lasted for four days, had 21 data scientists enrolled and four on the leader-board. Three winners were announced by Tekedia Institute, a United States-based institution with a focus on business management and leadership development. While appreciating the participants, Ola-Israel said the company would continue to take active steps to use data analysis to make a sustainable impact in the insurance space.
