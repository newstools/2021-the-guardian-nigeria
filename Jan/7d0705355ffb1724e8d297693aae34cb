The meats market where the car was stolen | Image: CNN A car thief who found a child in the backseat of the car he stole in Oregon, drove back and scolded the mother for leaving the child unattended. According to Oregon police, when the suspect saw the child, he returned to the mother and reprimanded her, threatened to call the police on her and then drove away in her car. “He hopped in the car, drove it, realized there was a 4-year-old inside, and drove back and ordered her to take the child out of the car and then drove away again,” Beaverton Police Spokesman Officer Matt Henderson told CNN. The crime took place at a meat market in Beaverton, where Crystal Leary left the engine of her car running and doors unlocked before going inside for a few minutes to purchase meat and a gallon of milk. A store employee told authorities the woman was in the market for a few minutes before someone began driving away with the SUV. “He actually lectured the mother for leaving the child in the car and threatened to call the police on her,” Henderson said. “We’re thankful he had the decency to bring the little one back.” The little boy was returned unharmed, police said. Henderson said the woman did nothing wrong and was within sight and sound of the child. He said the incident served as a “good reminder to take extra precaution” with children. The car, a 2013 silver Honda Pilot, was recovered a few hours later in Portland, just 8 miles away from Beaverton. Police are still searching for the thief, according to Henderson.
