Hospitality firm, Ziroc Residence, has assured guests of a more wholesome experience this year as they continue to make the hotel their choice destination in Lagos. The hotel management said several initiatives have been put in place to avail guests comfort, safety and the right ambience for business or leisure. This was made known in a statement while reviewing 2020 performance. It said: “We are constantly implementing best-in-class solutions to ensure guests receive value for money every time they stay at our hotel. One of these initiatives is implementing the health authorities’ recommended protocols to ensure guests are not exposed to COVID-19. “With studies indicating that transmission of the virus can be halted with high level hygiene, we regularly deep-clean our rooms and every other space with the major objective of reducing to zero the possibility of spreading the virus in our hotel. This is in addition to regular checks to limit the possibility of the spread of the virus on the hotel premises.” While thanking clients that have made the hotel their home away from home, the management further said it has invested in facility upgrade to enrich their experience. “Without our clients, we could not have come this far. We are restating our commitment to continue to make our guests the focus of our operations,” the statement said.
