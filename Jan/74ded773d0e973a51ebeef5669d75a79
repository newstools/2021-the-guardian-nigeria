Godzilla vs. Kong | Image: Warner Bros Picture The trailer for the upcoming monster film “Godzilla vs. Kong” which was released on Sunday gives a sneak peek of the upcoming showdown between two behemoth enemies. In the film, the mythic adversaries, Godzilla and Kong, meet in a spectacular battle for the ages, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home, and with them is Jia, a young orphaned girl with whom he has formed a unique and powerful bond. But they unexpectedly find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla, cutting a swath of destruction across the globe. The epic clash between the two titans — instigated by unseen forces — is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the Earth.  Godzilla vs. Kong is a sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as, Kong: Skull Island. It is also the fourth film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse. This is not the first time that the two monsters have faced off on screen, as they both appeared in the 1962 Japanese film King Kong vs. Godzilla. Godzilla vs. Kong is scheduled to be released simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max on March 26, 2021.
