Nigerian carrier, Air Peace airline, is scheduled to resume flight operations on Lagos-Dubai via Sharjah route next month. The airline is making a reentry following the suspension of international flights at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic and imposition of travel ban on Nigerian travellers by the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) authorities. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said with the travel ban lifted and safety protocols in place for travelers in COVID-19 era, Air Peace is set to resume once-a-week flight from February 5. “Lagos-Dubai will operate on Fridays while Dubai-Lagos leg will be on Saturdays. The flight frequency will increase subsequently, depending on observed passenger traffic. We urge our esteemed passengers to comply with all established COVID-19 protocols guiding international air travel,” Olisa said. It would be recalled that Air Peace launched its second international route – Lagos-Johannesburg operations – in December 2020, and has other international destinations in the offing, such as Mumbai-India, Guangzhou-China, Houston-U.S. and London.
