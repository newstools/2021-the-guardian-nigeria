About 400 persons have registered for skills empowerment programme organised by a not-for-profit organisation, Glorycloud Global Outreach, in Oyo State. The NGO seeks to empower individuals with relevant training and skills that can set them up for life and business. It also seeks to give back to its community by providing amenities and social support. Speaking at the programme unveiling, president of the group, Revd. Sunday ’Yinka Adebiyi, said empowering individuals had always been at the centre of its objectives. He said in addition to fulfilling the group’s pledge of giving back to the society, the initiatives were considered economic drivers capable of producing multiple effects. The two-week skill acquisition programme kicked-off with training on catering, fashion designing, web designing & digital marketing, and makeup & gele tying, among others. A graduation and award presentation would hold later, and the NGO would, on January 23, 2021, commission the Dream Centre, a media/viewing centre, where motivational and inspiring movies would be aired and talk shows would be shown.   A borehole facility constructed by the group for the Idi-Ata community in Oyo State would be handed over. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
