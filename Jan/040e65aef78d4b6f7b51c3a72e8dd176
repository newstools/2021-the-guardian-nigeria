He said: “I want to thank you for coming all the way for the flag-off of our party’s registration exercise. Your coming is important to further boost the morale of party members and draw new members… “Our party style and structure should no longer be Abuja downwards, but from the ward level upwards; so that people can defend the party and its policies, even at every level. The question of putting hands in pocket to get people to participate is no longer there, since we don’t have the money to share.” The President said elites in the country should be more reflective and fair in their assessment of the administration, noting that the strides recorded should be appreciated. “… From 1999 to 2014, our country produced 2.1million barrels of oil, and a barrel was over 100 dollars at some point. The economy was in such a terrible state after we came in, that we had to give bailout to states, so that salaries and pensions could be paid…” he said. Also, President Buhari has assured of full implementation of the 2021 budget, with all transparency and openness in meeting the targets, while appreciating the National Assembly for effective and detailed attention before passage. Speaking to newsmen in Daura, yesterday, Buhari said the budget aptly captured some of the administration’s visions, and all efforts would be put in to ensure effective implementation.
