The House of Representatives says there is no going back on the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) under consideration. Spokesperson of the House, Benjamin Kalu that the legislation will surely reinvigorate the petroleum industry and promote economic growth in host communities and the nation. Kalu explained that they are appalled at the scuffle which broke out between certain participants from the host communities at the public hearing of the PIB on Thursday, describing the action as not only contemptuous but constituting a breach to the House’s sanctity. He threatened that they won’t hesitate to arrest and prosecute anyone who perpetrates a similar occurrence in the future. “The deliberation of the PIB is to provide legal backing and protection for the development of host communities and for the collective good of the nation; a balance of interest between stakeholders of the petroleum sector.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
