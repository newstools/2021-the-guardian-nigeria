The Save our Women and Girls (SOW&G) Foundation has established Girl Leaders and Mentors Club (GLAM) to empower young girls for leadership positions.
 
GLAM, according to the foundation, is a platform for training, guiding and empowering young girls to be assertive, assume leadership roles and in turn mentor their peers.
 
At the launch recently, where about 50 girls were inaugurated into the club, Founder, SOW&G Foundation, Amb. Mrs. Unyime-King, said each girl would be mentored and equipped with the right tools and resources needed to effect positive changes.
