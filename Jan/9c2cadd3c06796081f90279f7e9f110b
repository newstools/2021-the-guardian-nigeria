Davido and Mayorkun in “The Best” video | Image: Twitter/davido Davido has shared the music video for his hit single “The Best” featuring Mayorkun. The song is a track off his latest album, A Better Time. In the Ninja-themed video, Mayorkun, with a scroll in hand, sojourns to a martial arts camp where he meets people clad in the traditional uniform used for Karate practice. He meets with the master of the camp, Davido, who dorns a black robe along with an Asian conical hat, with a red sheathed sword by his side. In no time, Davido is seen training Mayorkun, a reference to a line in the song: “You see I learnt from the best o, the best, Davido”. Wande Coal, who was referenced in the song, appears in a robe as a master overseeing a Karate class. Watch “The Best” music video below: Addressing his claim about being the best, Davido, in a series of tweet said that, we should all regard ourselves as the best: “‘The Best’ they say is relative. They say we should all regard ourselves as ‘The Best’ in order for us to believe sufficiently in ourselves. “Others say you’re arrogant when you proclaim yourself the best.”
