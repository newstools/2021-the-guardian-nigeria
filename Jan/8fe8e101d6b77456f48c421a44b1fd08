After years of soundtracking popular culture in Nigeria, Dotman is set to bring out his debut album,
“Hakuna Matata”, a project that distils his hit-making ability into a cohesive body of work.
He made an announcement to this effect in an Instagram post on Friday and the opening signs are
that he is the form of his life for this project. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1318547 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hakuna-matata-back--scaled-e1611404107173.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" /> Hakuna Matata opens with “Pele,” a mellow reflection on the path that has led him to his position.
“Chop Life” is another track as are “Feelings” and “Shuga.” With Hakuna Matata, the goal is simple: give listeners the very best of Dotman without over flogging
familiar themes. And while Dotman has made the pop single a true art form, with this album he shows that he is no one-trick pony. Enjoy!   A post shared by #HAKUNAMATATA THE ALBULM (@dotmanofficial)
