It also mandated the agency to ensure that the N3 billion Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) revenue targets for the 2021 fiscal year is met. It said the development will not only boost the revenue base of the FTC administration, but will also help to strengthen infrastructure development of the city. Recall that a lingering battle was drawn between the DOAS and AMAC on who was legally empowered by the FCT laws to collect taxes, fines and signages in the territory, but stakeholders waded into the matter to arrive at the solution. Speaking to journalists yesterday in Abuja, the AMAC Chairman, Abdulalahi Adamu Candido, said following several stakeholders meetings, both parties have agreed that DOAS will henceforth collect all taxes, rates, fines and signages on behalf of all parties concerned. He said: “As a responsible administration, this move will further assist in the harmonisation of taxes collections, avoid double taxation, improve on the ease of doing business in the territory, residents will now know who is legally qualified to collect taxes and fines from them, the cries on double taxation will end.” Responding, the FCT Director of DOAS, Dr. Babagana Adams assured that the revenue targets of N3billion for the 2021 fiscal year will be attained. He however, enjoined owners of illegal signages to come forward and pay the necessary fees before the laws catch up with them.
