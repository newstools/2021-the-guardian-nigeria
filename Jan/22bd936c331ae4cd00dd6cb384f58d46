 Late  Oba Dr. Rafiu Olusegun Salami  Specifically, the attention of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, and the Attorney General/Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo SAN have been drawn to the schemings by some unscrupulous kingmakers, who are allegedly planning to manipulate the selection process.
 
Some aggrieved members of the Oniwonlu Royal Family of Ibeju Kingdom, who raised the alarm, said it was necessary for the governor to intervene and to stop the affected politicians, who are bent on manipulating some kingmakers to foist a “candidate” that is not a blue blood to ascend the throne.
   
One of the factors aggravating the selection process, and also attracting the interest of politicians is that the Onibeju is one of the biggest monarchs and landowners in Lagos, and it is also a first-class king, who is in charge of a vast expanse of land in Ibeju-Lekki area.  Indigenes of Ibeju also seek the intervention of leaders and elders of the state, especially Governor Sanwo-Olu to investigate the matter.
 
Efforts to get the lawmaker representing the area in the state House of Assembly, Fatai Mojeed failed, as he was not on seat when the reporter visited his office, nor did he return calls, or reply a text message to his phone.
