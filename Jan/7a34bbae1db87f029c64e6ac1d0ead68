In a brief interaction with The Guardian, the truck driver, who introduced himself as Taiwo Ara, said the brake of his truck failed and while he was trying to avoid other vehicles on the busy road, he made effort to manoeuvre to the Murtala Mohammed Airport Road to avoid casualty, but he hit the okada rider, who stationed his bike at the bus stop awaiting for passengers going to Mile-2. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, January 27, 2020, the Lagos State government announced a restriction on commercial motorcycles and tricycles on major roads in the state, but in less than two months, the motorcyclists returned to major roads, including Toyota Bus Stop, due to high patronage by the Ladipo auto parts market traders.
