 Matthew Kukah  Specifically, the cleric complained to Bello and Balewa about the hardship the people suffer, following alleged destruction of the legacies, including public institutions, they tactically bequeathed to their people to build a solid foundation for prosperous future. In the letter, Kukah said: “I am not sure I know how to address you, especially now that the formal Ranka ya dade is of no use to you since you are now in eternity. However, because this is a very special year, I had decided to write two letters, one to you and the other to Sir Tafawa Balewa. “I thought I should start with you for obvious reasons. These letters are my formal way of having an imaginary conversation with both of you. In a way, I want to give you a report of what you left behind, what your immediate successors have done with your investment, and how they shared our inheritance to the descendants.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
