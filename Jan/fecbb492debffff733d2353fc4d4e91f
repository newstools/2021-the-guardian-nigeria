A former presidential spokesman, Doyin Okupe, says his son’s decision to openly declare himself a homosexual is a spiritual challenge. “For me I look beyond the surface or the physical. Here I see a major spiritual challenge…,” Okupe said in a Facebook post. “But I know as my God liveth, this whole saga will end up in Praise to the Almighty Jehova who I serve day and night.” Okupe’s statement came a day after his son Bolu announced his gay status in an Instagram post in which he held a LGBTQ flag behind. While Bolu’s sexuality caught some by suprise, his father said he has been aware of it before Bolu published the Instagram post. “I have been aware of this his new orientation for a while now,” Okupe said. “He (Bolu) knows that as a Christian and a witness for Christ (an evangelist), I am vehemently opposed to homosexuality as it runs contrary to the avowed precepts of my Christian faith.” Okupe served in the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Goodluck Jonathan when the anti-same-sex marriage bill was signed into law in January 7, 2014. Currently, Nigeria is one of the 68 countries where same-sex marriage is prohibited. The former presidential spokesman said he is hopeful that the ‘whole saga’ will end. “For it is written: Behold, the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is His ear dead that he cannot hear,” Okupe said quoting Isaiah 59 vs 1 in the bible. Regardless of Okupe’s stance against homosexuality, Bolu is unmoved and stands with his sexuality. “You are delusional,” Bolu said in response to an Instagram user criticising him. “I hope one day you will educate yourself. If not, I don’t care; you will die ignorant and on the wrong side of history.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
