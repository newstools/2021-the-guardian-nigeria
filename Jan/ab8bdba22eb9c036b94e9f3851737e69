Some of the vehicles to be auctioned The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit, known as Task Force, has obtained a ‘court order’ authorising it for a Public Auction of 88 vehicles forfeited by Lagos State Mobile Court. Chairman of the unit, CSP Shola Jejeloye, disclosed that the vehicles to be auctioned by the government were impounded by the enforcement team for driving against traffic (one-way) at different parts of the state. According to the chairman: “They were all arraigned and forfeited by court in line with Part (3) item (27) of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reformed Law of 2018.” Jejeloye confirmed that the public auction would hold in line with ‘Covid-19’ protocols on Wednesday, 20th of January, 2021 at the Agency’s Car Park, (Behind Shoprite), Alausa, Ikeja. He urged motorists, both private and commercial, to desist from driving against traffic (one-way), as the penalty is outright forfeiture of such vehicles to the government without any option of a fine. While reiterating the state government’s zero-tolerance for the violation of the law under any guise, the chairman confirmed that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had directed the operatives of the unit to continue prosecuting traffic offenders until sanity is restored on the roads and law-abiding citizens are allowed to commute without being impeded by unlawful individuals. Meanwhile, the Coordinator of the Lagos State Mobile Court, Mrs Arinola Ogbara Banjoko, confirmed that owners/drivers of these 88 court forfeited vehicles were arraigned before Chief Magistrate Micheal Olubi, Magistrate Lateef Layeni, Magistrate Oyebimbola Israel Adelakun, Magistrate Ibidun Abina and Magistrate Shakirat Obasa. She hinted that other traffic offenders caught plying BRT corridors or those causing obstructions to other road users were also arraigned and fined by Lagos State Mobile Court at Bolade, Oshodi.
