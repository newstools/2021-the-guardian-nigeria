We’re happy with his progress and we hope he’ll be back with the team soon.” Neymar will be sidelined for an eighth consecutive match against struggling Nantes, with striker Moise Kean still unavailable after testing positive last week for Covid-19. PSG face a key stretch of games before and after the international break, starting with the visit of Lille next week in the last 16 of the French Cup. They travel to Lyon in Ligue 1 on March 21 and then host leaders Lille at the start of April before resuming their Champions League campaign, having qualified for the quarter-finals.
