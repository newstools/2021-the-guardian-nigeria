Cross River State Governor, Benedict Ayade has disclosed plans to cultivate a rare regenerative organic grass called king grass to end farmers and herdsmen clashes in the country. A statement issued by Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, yesterday, said the governor stated this during a demonstration planting of the grass at the industrial park in Calabar, the state capital. He noted that Cross River was pioneering production of the special grass in collaboration with technical partners from Cambodia in furtherance of his administration’s agro-industrialisation drive, insisting that was all Nigeria needed to end the recurring farmer-herder clashes. “The grass is a special pasture that grows more than two meters within 45 days of planting and once it is cut, it regenerates even faster. So, within a small landmass herders can keep their cattle and grow the special grass to feed them. “Herdsmen have the right to the source of their livelihood, so they move from place to place in search of pasture for their cattle, thus pitting them against farmers who also have the right to protect their crops. “To end to this intractable conflict between the two groups, I have sought partnership with experts from Cambodia and they are here with the king grass,” he said. Ayade noted that the pilot scheme would be domiciled at the Obudu Cattle Ranch in Cross River North adding that the government was working to create a feeding lot where king grass would be grown and fed to cattle in the ranch. “My ambition is national security and oneness of this country. I, therefore, announce that Cross River has proffered a permanent solution to the famer, herders conflict in the country,” he added.
