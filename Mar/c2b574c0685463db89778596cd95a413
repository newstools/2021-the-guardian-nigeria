It not only deals with the curing of disease but also with the prevention of it, and its practices encourage you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It believes that when the energies in the body are in imbalance, a health problem manifests. To correct this balance is Ayurveda’s aim. One of the treatments that are frequently used towards this aim is the Swedana or steam therapy. In Ayurveda, ‘sweda’ literally means ‘to perspire’ and this particular therapy induces sweat in the person, using steam that has been produced incorporating a concoction of medicinal herbs. A typical session would involve being inside a steam box for a duration of approximately 15-20 minutes, with your body exposed to herb-infused steam that has been customised to address your particular issue. Depending on the symptoms, different herbs can be used in the steamer to aid quicker results. In COVID-19 times, it is ideal because it is a non-contact therapy. How will sweating help, you ask? Sweating helps to liquefy toxins in the body and then eliminate them, thereby reconfiguring the three doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—in the body. When stimulated by the high temperature, sweat glands galvanise toxins from the tissues in the mind and body, and then get rid of them. Our clients have seen detoxification benefits with just a single session. Especially those who normally don’t perspire too much, which, in effect, means their bodies are not releasing toxins efficiently. The steam helps to open pores and then releases these pent-up toxins. This naturally results in better skin and hair, and the improved blood circulation leaves you feeling energised and fresh. The therapy has also been especially useful to those suffering from pain in their muscles and joints. Recently, a lady had come to us with pain in her back and hip, and the steam helped to loosen up the taut muscles and joints and gave her enormous relief. It would really help those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, for example. Personally, Swedana has helped me clear up my congestion. I had a sinus infection, and am prone to nasal and throat congestion and allergies. I tried 2-3 sessions over three days, and it cleared me up completely. The therapy has also worked very well for weight loss, by helping patients get rid of water retention. One client lost 7 kilos over three weeks. For tangible results, we would advise six sessions, but of course this would depend from case to case. The only people who are advised against the treatment are pregnant women, people with low blood pressure, and those who are sensitive to heat and high temperature. You also have to remember to hydrate post the therapy because your body is losing salt and electrolytes when you sweat. The Swedana therapy is now available at Samkhya.
