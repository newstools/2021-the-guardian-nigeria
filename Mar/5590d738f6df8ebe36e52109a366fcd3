Okon, a former senator from Akwa ibom State and national caucus member of the PDP, wondered why the Federal Government descended on agitators in the South East with full military might, instead of deploying its might on the terrorists. “it is unfortunate that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has been treating insurgents and bandits with kid gloves, leaving them to operate freely in some parts of the north daily tormenting and dehumanising Nigerians. “The situation is giving Nigerians serious concern that the primary duty of government, which is to ensure security of life and property is no longer guaranteed under the Buhari administration. Okon lamented that the government that is overlooking activities of bandits and their cohorts who claim to be speaking and negotiating on their behalf in the north was all out to crush unarmed agitators in the Southeast with full military might. He argued that the Federal Government had declared war on Igbo land by deploying military aircraft that should have been used to crush banditry, terrorism, abduction of women and children in Zamfara, Kaduna and other parts of the north to the Southeast. Okon described the recent presidential order to shoot those carrying AK47 on sight as inadequate, maintaining that security agents needed express permission to decimate insurgents, criminals and bandits instead of that directive. “The present administration has further divided the country by jettisoning federal character and competence in appointments for tribal and clannish considerations, which have further eroded the fragile unity we have achieved in the country, we must work collectively to save the country back from disaster,” he said. On the recent meeting of elders and stakeholders from Eket and Uyo on the future of the state, Okon said it was Eket elders’ solidarity visit to Uyo to thank them for supporting Governor Udom Emmanuel and pledge their support for Uyo Senatorial District to produce the governor in 2023. “The 2023 permutation is not just about Uyo Senatorial District, but the turn of Itu/Ibiono federal constituency to produce the governor for justice and fair play,” he stressed describing Governor Udom’s completion agenda, as one that would further define the future of the state and solicited the support of all Akwa Ibom people to ensure its success.
