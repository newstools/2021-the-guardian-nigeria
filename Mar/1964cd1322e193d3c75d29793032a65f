Leader of the Biafra Independence Movement (BIM), Ralph Uwazuruike, has advised the South-East governors to accept and convert members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) to viable security outfit for the zone. Uwazuruike, who made the suggestion yesterday in Owerri while addressing journalists, said that the security group currently attached to the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), floated by Nnamdi Kanu, would perform better than throwing it away. He said that in his over 20 years of struggle from the days of the group’s name, Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), he had always used his members to agitate for Biafra in a non-violent manner, wondering why Nnamdi Kanu is allegedly calling for war and violent stance. He said: “I suggest that the South-East governors should take the Eastern Security Network (ESN), equip, train and make them responsive. “We cannot allow anarchy to prevail. We cannot allow war between Igbo against Nigeria.” Uwazuruike said that not even the emergence of an Igbo extraction president would halt struggle for the Biafra nation.
