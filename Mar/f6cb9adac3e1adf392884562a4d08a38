Plans are underway by DoGood.Africa in partnership with HB Imagino to empower 300 waste pickers and sorters in impoverished communities. The empowerment programmes tagged, â€˜Waste to Wealth, was made possible through a grant by The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF). Communications Lead at DoGood.Africa, Adewunmi Salami, who revealed this in Lagos, explained that the project was designed to contribute to several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in a bid to cushion the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, promote a greener environment and ultimately develop Nigeria as a whole. Managing Director of HB Imagino, Harold Okonoboh, said the project would revolutionise the way plastic waste is recovered in Nigeria. Head, Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability for Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe, disclosed that a total amount of $94,000 was committed by TCCF to addressing the needs of communities in Nigeria where the company operates. Organised to run for a year, the project is designed to recover over 500 tonnes of plastic waste at source by leveraging technology to digitally track waste disposal through RFID waste bins to be installed at strategic high volume consumption locations such as hotels, cafes, quick service restaurants and schools. With a pilot phase set to kick off within the Lekki axis of Lagos State, the project seeks to build momentum to scale this model across Africa in partnership with relevant stakeholders in the waste management value chain.
