Watch Trailer: Eyimofe Set To Premiere In Nigeria The first trailer for the much-awaited Film, Eyimofe(This Is My Desire) has been released. The indie movie, produced by GDN Studios, is set to premiere in Nigeria soon. The film has been shown in different film festivals around the world and has won different awards. “A real revelation of this year’s Berlinale,” American digital news outlet Slate said of the film. Set in Lagos, Nigeria Eyimofe follows the stories of Mofe, a factory technician, and Rosa, a hairdresser, on their quest for what they believe will be a better life on foreign shores. A passport, photos, and a visa form recurring elements. The characters’ misfortunes are part of their everyday life and they are sketching out the need to leave Nigeria at the same time. At the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, status, money, gender, skin colour, and family structures are inextricably connected. The longing for another life is but one thread in this complex mesh, a promise that floats above things at once near and far away. Watch the trailer below:
