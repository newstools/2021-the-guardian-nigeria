Victims Support Programme (VSF) has explained that it decided to provide boreholes, hand washing machines and sanitisers in 54 secondary schools across the the country to support the fight against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). VSF, which was set up by the Federal Government to rehabilitate, settle and empower victims of terrorism in the North East, but had its scope widened in 2020 to accommodate other parts of the country following the ravaging COVID-19, stated that the idea was also to improve hygiene in secondary schools. Speaking in Enugu State, during the commissioning of solar-powered boreholes, hand wash stations and other COVID-19 facilities, the Chairperson of VSF Taskforce on COVID-19, Mrs. Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji, stated that three South East states of Abia, Enugu and Anambra benefitted. She stated that in Enugu, the organisation spent N55 million to provide solar-powered boreholes, hand wash stations, reusable facemasks, hand sanitisers, liquid hand wash and bleach to three secondary schools. They include Girls Secondary School, Ngwo; Boys Secondary School Agbani; and Community Secondary School, Ugbene Ajima in Uzo-Uwani. “In this third phase of support, we provided items that the communities need. We meet with the stakeholders in every state and community to ensure the sustainability of what we will build in their area. We agreed that the washing facilities are what the community needs. We are here in Enugu to commission and hand over solar-powered borehole facilities of 4,000litres, four automatic foot pedal hand washing machine, hand sanitisers, disinfectant, face masks and many others in three schools. “We chose Enugu because of the way they managed the previous palliatives provided for them in the first phase. They shared the palliatives given to them accordingly. We have been going round the country commissioning the water facilities,” she explained. Akerele-Ogunsiji said that VSF supported Nigerians across the country with food, medical items and other palliatives in the second phase of the programme, and urged the communities to make good use of the facilities to reduce the spread of the pandemic. Enugu State Commissioner for Education, Prof. Uche Eze, while receiving the facilities, described them as a big boost in the state government’s effort to tackle the disease. He added that the state government had not relented in its advocacy for proper hygiene in the schools and would do all in its power to protect the students against the disease.
