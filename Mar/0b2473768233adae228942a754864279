 [FILES] Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare. Photo; TWITTER/SUNDAYDARESD  Dare, who is the new Agabaakin of Ogbomoso land, said he felt disturbed by Akande’s distress call because she was known to be a quiet and peace-loving politician with no history of frivolities or grandstanding such that she would be seeking undue attention or crying wolf in the absence of none. The Minister, in a statement he personally signed, tasked Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to treat the matter with all seriousness and ensure all-round protection for the former lawmaker. Dare also called on the security agencies to rise to the occasion and see that her life was not in danger in anyway. Dare said: “This is beyond politics. It is about the security of life and the right to life. She is an illustrious daughter of Oyo State and somebody that had served Nigeria at the peak of governance. An alarm of threat to life by such person or any other Nigerian for that matter deserves to be taken with the utmost earnestness. “I charge my brother, the governor of our state, Seyi Makinde, who is also the leader of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mulikat Akande’s party, to earnestly ensure that all-round protection is provided for her forthwith and guarantee that nothing untoward happens to her.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
