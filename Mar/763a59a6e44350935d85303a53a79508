Fayemi, who commended members of the LCDAs creation committee for honouring the call to serve the state, said that their report would receive necessary administrative attention. “Today, it is heart-warming that the committee inaugurated last year is here to submit its findings and recommendations to the government. I have no doubt that the committee would have done a thorough job on the assignment given in the best interest of the state. “The report will be painstakingly studied by the government for necessary administrative engagements to ensure an outcome that we can all be proud of. “A desirable outcome that will not only meet the yearnings of the people, but equally guarantee an equitable revenue allocation arrangement to ensure the sustainability of the LCDAs is paramount. “The inter-ministerial committee after reviewing the reports of the LCDAs creation committee is expected to propose an appropriate legal framework for the establishment of the proposed LCDAs, establish a framework for the distribution of assets, liabilities and personnel among the existing local councils and the proposed LCDAs and make practical commencement plan,among others.
