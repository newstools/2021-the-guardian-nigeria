Describing how he rushed to get a mat for his wife, he said: “So yeah, it was running to the gym, get a mat, get into the bathroom, get the mat on the floor, towels down, brace, brace, brace.” The baby was born at 6 pm on Sunday, he said. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said, “the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news and look forward to meeting their 10th great-grandchild when circumstances allow.” Zara Tindall is the daughter of Princess Anne, the Queen’s second child, and a first cousin of Princes William and Harry. Zara is a professional horse rider and previously won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics in the equestrian category. The arrival is the monarch’s 10th great-grandchild and is 22nd in line to the throne.
