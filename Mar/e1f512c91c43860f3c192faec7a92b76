To review Nigeria’s growth prospect for 2021Calls for foreign exchange market reform The International Monetary Fund (IMF), JP Morgan and the American Business Council (ABC) have recommended policy options that could aid economic recovery efforts in Nigeria.
  
According to the financial institutions, policy options for economic growth and recovery would border on increased pace of vaccination, domestic revenue mobilisation and foreign exchange reforms.
   
They added that the implementation of certain economic policies has become necessary due to rising inflation and unemployment in the country. The Mission Chief for Nigeria, IMF, Jesmin Rahman, noted that the upward review of Nigeria’s growth forecast was due to the recovery of oil prices and unexpected growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.  JP Morgan’s Chief Economist for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Ayomide Mejabi, said Nigeria might not get back to quick potential growth simply because a significant part of the labour force has been unable to recover, stating that a growth rate of two per cent this year is still quite low.
  
He said that while there is very limited scope to push the revenue mobilisation, the government needs to find a way to enhance tax collection as the nation would not gain more ground without reinvigorating the tax collection system.
