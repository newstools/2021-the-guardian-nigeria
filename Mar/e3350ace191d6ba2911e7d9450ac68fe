Chairman, Ministerial Expert Advisory Committee on COVID-19 and professor of Virology, Prof Oyewale Tomori has urged Nigerians especially frontline health workers not to allow misinformation and fake news about the COVID-19 vaccine deter them from getting vaccinated, insisting that it is safe and efficacious. He called on states yet to roll out vaccination to quickly get involved to protect the lives of residents. Speaking after receiving his first dose of the vaccine yesterday in Abuja, Tomori who decried alleged hesitancy among health workers in taking the vaccine, said it is in their best interest to take it in order to protect their lives against the disease so that everyone will return to normal life. He explained that the vaccine is not meant to prevent people from getting exposed to the virus but to stop infection from becoming a disease. On the impression that the Covid-19 vaccines were hurriedly produced compared to other vaccines, Tomori said it’s not true as the technology was already on ground and advancement are being made in every aspect of life including in vaccinology. He warned that people shouldn’t be talking of the long time effect of the vaccines either. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
