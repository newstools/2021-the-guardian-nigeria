 Watch: Angélique Kidjo Features Yemi Alade In New Song “Dignity” Angélique Kidjo has teamed up with the talented singer Yemi Alade for a new song called “Dignity.” The track was produced by Vtek da Awesom, and inspired by Nigeria’s youth movement, #EndSARS which has been protesting police brutality by the nation’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad. In a press release about the song, Angélique Kidjo said: Many people think that police brutality only happens in America, but it’s everywhere. This song is against brutality, but it’s also about how we need to treat each other with dignity, treat nature with dignity, and treat ourselves with dignity. Because if we can’t see the dignity that Mother Nature gave to all of us, then how can we walk tall? This will not be the first song between the duo. Angélique Kidjo and Yemi Alade last collaborated on the latter’s track “Shekere,” which appears on Yemi Alade’s 2019 album Woman of Steel. Watch below:
