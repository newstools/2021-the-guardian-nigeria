Black Lives Matter Co-Founder Opal Tometi Calls For Boycott Of The Royal Family The US co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement is calling for a boycott of the Royal Family after Meghan Markle’s bombshell claims in her interview with Oprah Winfrey. Opal Tometi, 36, in an interview on TMZ said she believed people should stop standing by the Palace after the Duchess of Sussex alleged one member of the family raised ‘concerns’ about Archie’s potential skin color when she was pregnant. Meghan told Oprah there were ‘concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born’. She added: That was relayed to me from Harry. Those were conversations that family had with him. The couple refused to name the person who made the comments but Prince Harry reportedly told Oprah off-air that they were not made by the Queen or Prince Philip. Tometi, a prominent activist, said the allegations should make people turn their backs on the Royal Family, according to TMZ. She said black women like Meghan should be believed when they speak out. Palace insiders have reacted with horror at the allegations, saying it was deeply unfair to throw around such a damaging accusation, potentially libeling a number of senior royals who are unable to defend themselves. It was also pointed out that there was no context to the alleged comment, which might shed more light on why it was said. And there appeared to be a contradiction about when it was said, with Meghan saying it was while she was pregnant, while Harry said it had happened before their wedding according to The Daily Mail. Winfrey said she had been ‘shocked’ at the alleged comment regarding Archie’s skin tone, but although she had tried to ask Harry for more information, both on and off-camera, he had refused to divest more. However, he told her he wanted it made clear that the person concerned was ‘not his grandmother nor his grandfather’.
