To stop distressed buildings from causing major havoc in the state, the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LABSCA) and the state’s Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) yesterday, began a renewed enforcement of government’s stance on zero tolerance to illegal developments with the sealing of 35 building sites across the state. The enforcement team led by the General Manager of LABSCA, Gbolahan Oki, visited several construction sites and buildings in Eti-Osa, Magodo, Ogudu, Gbagada Phase II, and other parts of Lagos. Speaking during the exercise, Oki said the 35 sites were sealed for offences that centre on construction without permit and failure to obtain necessary authorisation from authorities. Specifically, he noted that officials of the agency sealed a highly distressed building, waiting to collapse at No. 33, Oko Baba Street, Ebute Metta, and dispersed the school children inhabiting the building. Oki said: “While the officials of LASPPPA were on ground to ascertain and validate the approvals obtained by the various construction sites visited as well as monitor layouts and development schemes, the officers from LABSCA were on ground for identification of distressed and non-conforming building while also inspected and certified various stages of building construction works.” The General Manager said the enforcement drive would be a continuous and pleaded with residents to follow proper channels in processing their construction works and necessary permits from the State Government, reiterating the determination of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration to ensure that buildings in the state are designed, constructed and maintained to high standards of safety to avoid loss of lives and properties.
