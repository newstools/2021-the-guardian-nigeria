The Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) has applauded the role played by its committee in bringing sanity to Apapa through the recent-introduced electronic call-up system. Chairman of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Apapa Branch, Christian Ufot, said before the introduction of the call-up system, Apapa was a nightmare for road users. Ufot, who spoke at a briefing to mark the branch’s 20th anniversary, said the involvement of the committee of engineers has brought sanity to Apapa and its environs. According to him, one of the mandates given to the association is to solve the gridlock challenge in the state by developing professional capacity. He said: “In October 2020, during the inauguration activity of the branch, the President of NSE, Babagana Mohammed, gave the branch a mandate to identify the causes and propose solutions to the Apapa gridlock. “That committee went to work immediately and by January 2021, the committee concluded and submitted its report which was adopted by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and Lagos State Government.” Apapa had for several years defied efforts put in place to solve its gridlock, including a presidential task team intervention. The immediate past chairman of the branch, Sunny Ejeje, has called on engineers to participate in politics to contribute to the development of the country.
