Restraining Order Against Tamar Braxton By Ex-Boyfriend David Adefeso Dismissed A restraining order against Tamar Braxton brought by her boyfriend David Adefeso in a Los Angeles court has been dismissed. Neither the 43-year-old songstress nor her ex attended the Tuesday hearing, leading the court to dissolve the legal arrangement according to a report by The Dailymail. Adefeso obtained the restraining order against Tamar, who is the younger sister of R&B staple Toni Braxton, last September amid claims that she had made death threats against him, and had assaulted him while he was driving. The All the Way Home songstress, appearing on The Tamron Hall Show in October, denied her ex’s claims. In her words: I am a survivor of a domestic violence relationship. And not at any point [were] David and me in an abusive relationship. She said that she had audio recordings which proved her innocent of any physical abuse in the exchange. She opened up on the lighter times of her relationship with Adefeso. Let me tell you something, I loved David. He was my best friend. He was an amazing, amazing partner. He was my son’s best friend as well, they were best friends. And it’s just so hard because, through everything else, I never expected this from him. Adefeso told People in September in a statement that he wished Braxton the best in terms of her ‘mental and emotional stability,’ enunciating that he was ‘the victim in this situation.’ However, since both have refused to show up in court, the restraining order has been dismissed.
