Saturday’s Fulani armed militia attack on Governor Samuel Ortom may have forced Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) to deploy troops to the Tyo-Mu and Abintse general area to forestall recurrence. OPWS Commander, Maj-Gen. Adeyemi Yekini, disclosed this yesterday, while conducting journalists round the area where armed men reportedly attacked the governor. Yekini, who was at the scene of the attack with the Security Adviser to the Governor, Col. Paul Hemba (rtd.), stated that his troops would sustain patrol in the area for a while. He said: “We are here to show you that the general area is clear of bandits. The security breach is quite unfortunate. We should not be judged by this singular assignment. We have accepted it was a security breach and we will take action.” The commander further intimated that since their coming on board three years ago, over 1,000 armed criminals had been neutralised, and close to 700 weapons recovered in Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states, with the highest number of recovery made in Benue. According to Yekini, no day passes without the troops neutralising bandits in the Sankera axis of Benue. He, however, urged the people of Sankera, made up of Ukum, Logo and Katsina-Ala, to cooperate with security operatives by giving useful information that would help them flush out criminals in the area. Also addressing newsmen at the scene of the attack, the Security Adviser, who disclosed that five empty shells of bullets were recovered from the area, added that no arrest had been made, except three local fishermen intercepted in the general area that were invited for questioning after which they were allowed to go home.
