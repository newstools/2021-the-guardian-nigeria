 Broad band connection  The African Union (AU) has noted that though there has been a huge expansion of fibre optic networks on the continent (which have extended from 278 056 km in 2009 to 1.02 million km in June 2019), nearly 300 million Africans still live more than 50 km from a fibre or cable broadband connection.
   
This, the AU noted, has stalled some significant growths, especially digital transformations among countries within the region. Checks by The Guardian showed that broadband penetration fell by 2.14 per cent in three months between November 2020 and January 2021 with some 4.1 million Nigerians losing access. As of November 2020, there were 86 million users; it dropped to 81.9 million by January, according to subscriber statistics from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).
   
Market watchers attributed the drop partially to the NIN-SIM directive of the Federal Government and access cost. AU said achieving universal coverage of communications infrastructures requires place-based policies to overcome spatial inequalities.
