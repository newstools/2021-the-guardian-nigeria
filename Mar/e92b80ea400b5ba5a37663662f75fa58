The Chairman of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Apapa Chapter, Sylvester Budu, has faulted the slow pace of work at the access roads linking Apapa ports. Budu who expressed dissatisfaction with the speed of work advised that the projects should be treated as an emergency that requires working 24-hour attention, especially during the dry season. Speaking to newsmen in Lagos, he added the poor state of the roads has contributed to the high cost of clearing at the seaports. “They should have taken advantage of the dry season to work 24-hours on the roads. They should be a priority. December and early January were a nightmare. The road leading to Tin Can port is a disaster; you find it difficult to get containers to in,” he said. According to Budu, the road has affected the cost of delivery and made life difficult for agents and importers. “When it takes you time to bring out a consignment at a very exorbitant price, it will affect the final consumers. We have experienced over a 300 per cent increase in the cost of clearing. Before this crisis, a 20foot container going to Alaba International Market from Apapa cost N400,000 to N450,000. But we paid almost N1.6 million in December,” he stressed. The ANLCA chieftain also expressed support for the newly-introduced electronic call-up system, describing it as a policy that could address the persistent gridlock.
