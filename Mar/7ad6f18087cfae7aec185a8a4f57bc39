The maiden edition of the Oodua Unity Cup, sponsored by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, will begin on March 29, the organisers have said. The grassroots competition, organised by the Youth Sports Federation of Nigeria (YSFON) for the six states in the South West, will begin with the zonal preliminaries on March 29 and end on April 12. According to a statement by the tournament coordinator, Kehinde Adeyemi, the new YSFON grassroots soccer tourney is designed to unearth talented U-17 boys and U-18 girls in the South/West states of Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Ondo, Lagos and Ekiti. Adeyemi urged the officials and coaches of the grassroots teams to adhere strictly to the stipulated age categories, adding that YSFON will not compromise the laid down guidelines to realize the aims and objectives of the tourney. Meanwhile, YSFON’s Vice President, South/West, Rafiu Abayomi Alabi, who is the head of local organizing committee (LOC), has donated match balls and bibs to all states participating in the competition as a way to ease some of their logistical needs.
