 Archery  The week-long event, which started with seminar/workshop, has athletes drawn from states like Lagos, Ogun, Kwara, Kogi, Benue and Imo, while the Armed Forces, Police, Road Safety, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and some unattached archers are also in attendance. Nigeria Archery Federation President, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the championship, which was delayed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, couldn’t have come at a better time than now that global sports are gradually returning after almost one year of inactivity. He said the championship would not only put Nigerian archers in a competition mood but also help them to adequately prepare for both continental and global challenges. Mohammed Baba Abdullahi also revealed that a lot of championships are already lined up globally, especially in America, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, including Africa, hence the need to get Nigerian archers on track. He hinted that athletes to form the core national team will be selected from this championship based on performance, and enjoined the participants to put in their best. The championship, which started yesterday after the seminar/workshop, would end on Saturday with medals and trophies already lined up for winners.
