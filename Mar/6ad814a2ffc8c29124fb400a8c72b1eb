Justin Bieber Features Burna Boy In Forthcoming Album Justin Bieber has announced his new album Justice. The follow-up to last year’s Changes is out on March 19. The record will include Bieber’s 2020 songs “Holy” (featuring Chance the Rapper), “Lonely” (featuring benny blanco), and “Anyone.” For the cover of the album, Justin Bieber wrote: JUSTICE the album March 19th. In a time when there’s so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone. Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren’t alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another. I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united. This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to heal. Also, there are hints that Burna Boy will be featured in the new album. It was reported that Justin Bieber and Burna Boy were seen making music together. The official tracklist of ‘Justice’ has not been announced yet. In a new post, he has, however, announced “Hold on” will be released on Friday.   A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)
