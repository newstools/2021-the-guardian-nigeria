• Backs Constitutional Review In Favour Of Gender Equality The United Nations (UN) has said that the participation of more women in political offices and decision making positions in Nigeria, would ensure sustainable development and end all forms of discrimination against them. The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, made this known at the marking of the 65th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) held in Abuja. Kallon said unless barriers to achieving gender equality are removed, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would continue to be a mirage. He said the less than five per cent of women’s participation in politics in Nigeria is unacceptable because of the devastating implications it portends such as continued inequality, gender-based violence and poor quality of living among others. Represented by the UN Women and ECOWAS representative to Nigeria, Comfort Lamptey, Kallon asked the president of the Senate to consider more robust legal framework that ensures women’s political stance in the proposed constitution amendment. Expressing confidence that Nigerian women would have a cause to smile by the next election in 2023, the Minister of Women’s Affairs, Pauline Tallen, said women must not be discouraged but should continue to find ways to contribute to national development. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Youth Congress (NYC) has called on governments at all level to fully carry along the youth in its policies, programmes and interventions projects for an efficient and sustained national development. National President of the body, Mr. Blessing Akinlosotu, made the call at a congress tagged ‘Mainstreaming the Youth in National Development Agenda as a Strategic Tool for Youth Empowerment’, at the weekend in Abuja. He said Nigerian youths are ready more than ever before, to contribute to moving the nation forward by taking responsibility for issues and challenges affecting their present and future. While lamenting that a lot of young Nigerians are still lagging behind in taking up the challenge of nation building, Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and Chairman of the occasion, Kayode Fayemi, called on Nigerian youths to desist from all forms of laziness and be more productive. Chairman of NYC’s Governing Board, Yakubu Shendam, expressed confidence that young people in Nigeria have come of age and are already making huge contributions to the country but want to do even more in terms of political opportunities at the national level.
