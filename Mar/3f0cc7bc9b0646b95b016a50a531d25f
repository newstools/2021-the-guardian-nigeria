• Stranded customers lament the inability to retrieve lines despite having NIN
• MNOs decry NIMC back-end facilities; employ ‘Pareto Principle on subscribers
• NATCOMS wants court order on extension honoured
• NIN issued may have reached 75m in eight weeks If the court order demanding two months extension of NIN-SIM registration stays, it would have been five months of no SIM registration and activation in the country.  MEANWHILE, findings by The Guardian at the weekend revealed a huge increase in the number of National Identity Number (NIN) that have been allocated to Nigerians. A source close to the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) confirmed that the number has increased tremendously in the last four weeks.
  
The source hinted that the number now ranges between 70 million to 75 million Nigerians with NIN. According to him, as of December 2020, NIN issued by NIMC was around 43 million, “but with the Federal Government’s directive on NIN-SIM and the licensees, the number has increased tremendously.”  MEANWHILE, some of the operators, which spoke with The Guardian on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that MNOs intervention was actually what brought huge progress into the entire process.
  
According to them, the licenses handed them by the FG helped the registration process to scale by as much as 70 per cent within two months.
  
While calling for more ecosystem synergy that will ensure the process is delivered adequately and timely, the operators decried that the handshake between MNOs and NIMC facilities remains a huge challenge.
   
They lamented that it is still difficult to transmit and linking data collected from their end to the NIMC backend, which according to them was due to obsolete equipment on the part of the commission.  The fact is, no operator wants to lose any subscriber. A blocked SIM is revenue lost. I can say that as we are speaking, we have virtually linked all our SIM cards to their NIN.”
  
Another operator also shared the same sentiment. According to her, the challenge has been prioritizing the subscribers. “As much as we don’t want to lose any telecoms user, there have been some constant follow up on some high net worth customers to ensure they get their NINs and linked with their SIMs as fast as possible. For us, about 55 per cent of our SIM cards have been linked to their NIN.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
