He said that the reception would engender a reduction in the spread of the virus when about 75 per cent of the population was immunised. “According to National Primary Health Care Agency (NPHCA), over two million persons have registered for the vaccine; therefore people are willing to get immunity against the virus. “If the health workers who are front liners in the fight against COVID-19 get immunised, certainly infections and deaths will reduce,” he said. Oji who lauded the Federal Ministry of Health for making it possible for Nigeria to receive the vaccine, called on Nigerians to take the vaccine. The medical practitioner expressed optimism that the end to the spread of the virus had begun with the reception of the vaccine. He urged Nigerians to dismiss rumours and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories surrounding the vaccine, saying that only a synergy of all would contain the virus. NAN reports that 3,924 doses of COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Abuja on Monday, the third and largest delivery so far to an African country by the global COVAX initiative. The COVAX programme shipped close to four million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, from Mumbai to Nigeria.
