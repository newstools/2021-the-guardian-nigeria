 Lalong  The Publicity Secretary of PDP, John Akans, alleged yesterday that Governor Simon Lalong terminated the contract because the contractors refused to share the money with government officials. But the secretary of the state’s APC, Bashir Sati, debunked the allegation, calling on the PDP to support it with proof. APC had said that Akans concocted lies in furtherance of his faction’s search for relevance and to bring the government of Lalong into disrepute. “In his usual empty, childish, and incoherent rhetoric, the factional spokesperson alleged that Governor Lalong terminated N59 billion legacy project contracts over the refusal of the contractor to share money. It is a tragedy that out of a lousy disposition and in a haste to smear the character of the governor, the so-called factional spokesman of the PDP forgot to get even the most basic facts, which are already out there in the public domain, right. “Despite claiming that his faction of the PDP had documents to buttress his claims, the factional spokesperson displayed crass ignorance on the genesis and current state of the Lalong Legacy Project. Little wonder, he was only interested in the so-called whopping N59 billion figure for the initial contract signed between the Plateau government and Bleneson Services Nigeria Limited,” he said. However, according to a statement by Akans, the attention of PDP in the state has been drawn to a corrupt and shameful practice of Lalong’s administration in terminating the contract valued at N59 billion for the much-talked-about legacy projects.
