He said that when he visited the waterfalls and discovered the biggest challenge was road infrastructure, the state awarded an N3 billion contract for the road network leading to the site. “We have just taken over the road, we spent N3 billion and the road has been completed. “I also want to use this opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the contract for the construction of a dam at the site. “I can confirm to you that work has commenced on the dam project at the site. “With all these in place, I can say that we have completed the cycle and what we are waiting for is for the minister to promote the waterfalls so that investors will key into it,’’ he said. The governor said that the bottom table of the waterfalls could generate 15 mw of power while at the dam itself after construction is completed, they could easily generate 25mw of power, totaling 40 mw capacity. He called on potential investors to take advantage of the top of the waterfalls as a conference centre could be built there.
