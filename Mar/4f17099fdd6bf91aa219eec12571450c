Grammy 2021: Burna Boy Among Others To Perform At Award Show Image MJ Photos Nigerian act Burna Boy will perform at the 2021 Grammy pre-show which will be live-streamed on Grammy.com at 3 p.m. EST on March 14. The premiere ceremony will be hosted by Jhene Aiko with previous Grammy nominees including Gregory Porter, Afro-Peruvian Jazz Orchestra, Regina Carter, and Kamasi Washington performing “Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)” in tribute to the late legend Marvin Gaye. The 2021 Grammy Awards was originally scheduled to take place in January before it was postponed to March due to the “deteriorating COVID situation in Los Angeles.” In December, it was announced that Talking Heads, Salt-N-Pepa, Selena, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, and more would receive Lifetime Achievement Grammys. Burna Boy is nominated at the 2021 Grammy Awards in the Best Global Music Category alongside Tuareg desert rock group Tinariwen, NYC afrobeat outfit Antibalas, Brazilian-American Bebel Gilberto, and British-Indian sitar player Anoushka Shankar. Previously known as the international category of Best World Music Album, the category was renamed to “make it more modern and inclusive.” This is Burna Boy’s second Grammy nomination after losing to the iconic Angelique Kidjo during the last ceremony. Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, known as Burna Boy and popularly called African Giant, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, rapper, and dancer. He is one of the biggest and most successful African artists.
