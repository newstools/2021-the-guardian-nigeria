Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has suspended Kano-based airline Azman Air Limited. Azman Air was suspended Tuesday morning for operational lapses and failure to comply with aviation safety guidelines and protection of passengersâ€™ rights. Passengers on Azman Air narrowly escaped a fatal crash on Monday when the flight had a tyre burst while landing in Kaduna. A similar incident occurred two weeks ago at Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Abuja when a Azman aircraft sustained tyre damage on landing at the airport. Management staff at Azman Air headquarters in Kano confirmed the suspension to The Guardian. He, however, claimed the suspension is temporary and will soon be rectified.
