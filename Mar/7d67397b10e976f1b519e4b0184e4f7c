Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission (PCACC) has alleged diversion of food and non-food materials meant for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the state. Executive Chairman of PCACC, Muhuyi Gado, alleged that preliminary investigation suggested that items meant for the vulnerable persons were already being siphoned by unscrupulous elements in a government agency. Gado spoke while receiving the new Commissioner, Independent Corruption Practices and Other Related offences Commission (ICPC), Kano Zonal office, Ibrahim Kagara, in his office. The anti-graft agency was worried by reports that large-scale fraud and diversion of relief items supplied to IDPs in Kano by the National Commission for Refugees, Migrant and Internally Displaced Persons recently. About 46,000 persons were said to have lost property worth billions of naira to flood, fire incident and other natural disasters in Kano in 2020. According to Gado, it is painful to find those responsible for the management and distribution of the relief items behind the nefarious act of planning to divert the items. Lamenting several attempts, including legal subterfuge, to distract activities of the commission, he reaffirmed the commission’s determination to remain focused and guided by the statutory laws establishing the commission. While congratulating the new ICPC commissioner, Gado extended hands of fellowship to the Federal Government’s anti-graft agency to rid Kano of corruption and other related tendencies. Earlier, Kagara had pledged a cordial working relationship with the Kano anti-graft commission to form a synergy in the fight against corruption. According to him, corruption is such a serious problem in the country that needs concerted efforts of the sister agencies and other stakeholders to tackle it more effectively.
