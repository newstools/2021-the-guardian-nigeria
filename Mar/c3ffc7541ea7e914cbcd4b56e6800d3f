The Justice Reform Project, a coalition of Nigerians across the legal profession have expressed concern over a bill proposed by the Body of Benchers to replace the Legal Practitioners Act CAP L11, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, aimed to re-enact a new Legal Practitioners Act and to regulate the legal profession.
 
According to the group, the legal profession and its stakeholders are widely ignorant of the far-reaching piece of legislation, which has not been discussed by branches of the Nigeria Bar Association to know the implication. They added that the bill is replete with self-serving and retrogressive provisions, which will prejudice the public interest in a strong, effective, and independent legal profession.
 
“The effect of the bill is to give the power of control and regulation of the legal profession to the Body of Benchers through its various Committees. It further states that the Body of Benchers shall determine the terms of reference, regulations, and mode of appointment, tenure, quorum, and manner of meetings of each Committee.
 
“The proposed membership of the Body of Benchers under section 1(3) of the Bill is to now also include some of the following: President of the National Industrial Court, Life Benchers, the President of the Senate (if a lawyer), the Speaker of the House of Representatives (if a lawyer), and Chairmen of the National Assembly Committees on Judiciary (if they are lawyers),” the group pointed out.  “The Speaker of the House of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal matters and the Chairman of the Federal Judicial Committee (House of Representatives) would be eligible to take their place on the Body of Benchers,” they fumed.
