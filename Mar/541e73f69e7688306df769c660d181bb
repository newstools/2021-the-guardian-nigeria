 [FILES] Okowa. Photo: TWITTER/IAOKOWA  Okowa made the call yesterday when he received Minister of State for Health, Olurunnimbe Mamora, who visited him at Government House, Asaba. He said that the Federal Government spent lots of money in subsidizing fuel for the rich, without consideration for the vulnerable in the society, adding that the country would experience peace if 25 percent of those funds were deployed for an insurance scheme for the less-privileged. He commended the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for their efforts in the management of the pandemic. He also lauded Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba, saying they had been of immense help in the handling of COVID-19 patients in the state. Okowa encouraged Nigerians to make themselves available for the vaccine, saying that it was safe. Earlier, the minister had told the governor that he and his delegation were in Delta to inspect facilities at the FMC, Asaba and thanked him for his contributions to the management of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Mamora commended Okowa for his support to the FMC in Asaba, saying, “Without any iota of doubt you have shown serious commitment to the welfare of the FMC, and your kind gesture is highly appreciated and that’s why we are here to acknowledge your good deeds and support.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
