The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has successfully reunited 15 children who were victims of human trafficking with their parents. In February 2020, the children, between the ages of two to 13 years, were reportedly deceptively taken from their parents in Lapai, Niger State, by one Emmanuel Abraham, 30 and Nkechi Udoh, 53, with a pretext of giving them education. The FCT Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Yusuf Mariam, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, said further investigation revealed that the suspects ‘distributed’ the children to different people. She noted that suspects were arraigned in court upon conclusion of investigation. “In view of the above, the command is appealing to parents to be extremely conscious of the safety and movement of their children at all times. “Also, the command wishes to use this medium to dissociate itself from the misleading information being circulated by fraudulent elements that ‘it is conducting an auction of vehicles.’ There is no ongoing auction exercise in the FCT command, therefore, members of the public should note that it is one of the antics by fraudsters to defraud unsuspecting citizens. “We enjoin residents to remain calm, law-abiding, comply with all COVID-19 regulations and reiterate our unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT. “The command implores residents to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress, through these numbers: 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653 and 08028940883. To report the conduct of police officers, call the Public Complaint Bureau (PCB) line: 09022222352.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
