Speaking during the dinner organised for members of the national team on Wednesday night by the Lagos State government, Musa said the players were looking forward to playing at the Lagos National Stadium like other legends of the game. He said: “We will like the stadium to be ready before our next round of games so that we can write our names as members of the Super Eagles that played on the hallowed ground.” Musa, who presented gifts of signed jerseys to Governor Sanwo-Olu and his wife, boasted that the Eagles would beat the Benin Republic in Porto Novo to break their invincibility at home. The Nigerian contingent to the Benin Republic for the African Cup of Nations qualifier is expected to leave the country tomorrow morning for the game scheduled to hold in the evening.
