Operators have been urged to diversify insurance products to meet the needs of every individual in the country. Besides, they called on the public to appreciate the significance of insurance in reducing risks. The Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, Great Nigeria Insurance Plc, Mrs. Cecilia Osipitan, in an interview with The Guardian at the weekend, said that there is a need to see information and communication technology (ICT) as the driver of insurance growth. According to her, despite the slow insurance adoption, there is hope that penetration and premium payment will rise as the industry is beginning to do well. Osipitan explained that the organisation remains committed to its vision and shared values with innovative ideas on how to move the company forward while ensuring the implementation of all measures and strategies to drive growth. According to her, the company pays particular attention to excellent service delivery and the adoption of global best practices in all areas of its operation. She said: “We are out to reshape the industry, we are also aware that we cannot attain the top five positions in the industry if our service delivery is questionable. At the same time, we strive to imbibe global best practices in all facets of our operation to ensure we remain at the frontline.” According to her, the company has put in place modalities that will ensure effective coordination of its re-positioning and re-structuring strategies to deepen market penetration. “The company set out to chart a professional course in the practice of insurance business in Nigeria. We will not leave any stone unturned in the quest of attaining the status of a world-class insurance company. We are poised to meet our obligations as and when due”, she concluded.
