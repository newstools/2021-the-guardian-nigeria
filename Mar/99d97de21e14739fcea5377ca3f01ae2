The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Abuja Wednesday sealed about eight fuel stations for infractions amidst intrigues over the pump Price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and prevailing implications. Zonal Operation Controller for Abuja, Abubakar Buba, during a surveillance exercise to some petrol stations in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) warned marketers to desist from hoarding the product and other infractions. “During the cause of our surveillance, eight stations were sealed for various infractions, no station was found hoarding or with safety violation and no queue of motorist seen in all stations. As it is part of our regular exercise, DPR will continue to intensify its surveillance activities on all retail outlets within the zone and violators will be sanctioned accordingly,” Buba said. Following the development in the southwest part of the country, where a fuel station was dispensing water to motorists due to water ingress in underground tanks, Buba warmed marketers in the FCT to adopt preventives measures and ensure good operational practices ahead of raining season. He said all fuel stations must ensure that manholes are properly covered after every stocktaking, ensure regularly check for water using pastes during discharge and before the commencement of sales, ensure the use of tamper-proof manholes and other seal devices on petroleum products. Buba said DPR has enhanced surveillance and monitoring of all fuel stations within and around the FCT to sustain compliance with product availability, product quality, enforcement of approved pump price and consumer protection and public safety. According to him, hoarding, diversion, adulteration and under-dispensing shortchange the masses and would not be tolerated.
