Pastor W. F. Kumuyi One man in the Bible was always quick to Balaam consistently affirm his consecration. He sounded like a dependable prophet who disregarded covetousness and even “said unto Balak… the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak”. He seemed to be a spiritual man who prayed to “die the death of the righteous”. But he was covetous and counselled Balak to make Israel commit sin because of covetousness. He also joined the Moabites to fight against God’s people. “And they slew the kings of Midian… Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword”. As believers, we must eschew every form of double-speak. We should not say nice things in the open and negative things in the secret. We must be faithful and sincere to be recognised by the Lord. “Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom”. This wisdom is: one, endued with knowledge for the proper interpretation of the word of God (Ecclesiastes 8:1; Daniel 2:21). Two, it comes with a “good conversation,” which turns the hearts of people to the Lord. Our conversation should be “as it becometh the gospel of Christ…” Wisdom affects the tongue of the believing wife. With it, she wins her unbelieving husband to the Lord, “While they behold [her] chaste conversation coupled with fear” (Philippians 1:27; 1 Peter 3:1,2). Three, it has the “meekness of wisdom” to counsel and preach. “In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth” (2 Timothy 2:25; Galatians 6:1,2). Four, the wisdom from above is pure and peaceable. As a preacher, you should not use the pulpit to attack those who oppose you in the church. Whether they like you or not, “If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men” (Romans 12:18,19; Hebrews 12:14). Five, this kind of wisdom is gentle and merciful. Gentleness and mercy should characterise your ministry (Isaiah 40:11; 1 Thessalonians 2:7). Six, it has no partiality and hypocrisy. Only a vile person practises “hypocrisy, and …utter error against the LORD…” (Isaiah 32:6; 1 Timothy 5:21). Seven, this wisdom is characterised by “the fruit of righteousness.” When God gives us this wisdom, it produces the fruits of righteousness in our ministry (Philippians 1:11-14). Thus, our lives become an inspiration and encouragement to other people. It also brings about progress in our lives, families and ministries.
