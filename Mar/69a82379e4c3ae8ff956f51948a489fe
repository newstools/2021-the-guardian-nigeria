 Britney Spears | Photo RCA Records  “I didn’t watch the documentary but from what I did see of it I was embarrassed by the light they put me in,” she wrote on Instagram late Tuesday, in her first response to “Framing Britney Spears”, a documentary produced by FX and the New York Times released in February. The film which first aired on Feb. 5, highlights the rise and fall of Spears’ career, her mental health challenges, inappropriate treatment by unrelenting media and the controversial conservatorship of her father, who was given legal guardianship over her finances in 2008 following a highly publicised breakdown. “I cried for two weeks and well …. I still cry sometimes !!!!” Spears wrote about watching the film. “My life has always been very speculated … watched … and judged really my whole life !!!” she wrote elsewhere in the message, which was accompanied by a video of her dancing to “Crazy” by Aerosmith. “It takes a lot of strength to trust the universe with your real vulnerability because I’ve always been so judged, insulted and embarrassed by the media, and I still am to this day.” Spears filed last year to remove her father Jamie Spears from the conservatorship and give sole power over her estate to a financial institution. Her court-appointed lawyer said she was “afraid” of her father. A judge ruled in February that both Spears’ father and Bessemer Trust would oversee the pop star’s finances, denying Jamie Spears’ bid to keep sole power to delegate investments, though the case is ongoing.
