Decouple BPE from mainstream bureaucracy, says Yusuf As the confusion remains over the pump price of petrol after Friday’s withdrawal of a purported price template for March by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), there have been renewed interest in the state of the nation’s refineries. The Federal Government is proposing to sell or concession no fewer than 36 of its properties to raise funds to finance the 2021 budget. Top among these properties are the three refineries in Kaduna, Warri and Port Harcourt, Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), Abuja International Conference Centre (ICC), Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Abuja Water Board, Nigerian Film Corporation, Tafawa Balewa Square, among others. There are, however, different sale strategies for the properties. While some are ‘core investor sales’, a few others are for ‘share sales’. Some are for ‘concessioning’ and others for ‘full or partial commercialisation’. Some properties have been enlisted to be sold to a ‘willing buyer’. WHILE the proposal to sell assets is not new in Nigeria, having been mooted several times, the ability of the Federal Government to effectively implement the process amid issues of transparency and accountability remain part of hurdles yet to be surmounted in the proposed sale of dead assets.
 
For instance, the Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC), identified for possible sale is scheduled to undergo another round of turnaround maintenance (TAM) in April, despite not producing anything. So, why spend on TAM again and when is it going to be put up for sale?
 
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, had last month, said it was able to cut down losses by 53 per cent in the first 10 months of 2020, due to none production in the nation’s four refineries, according to data obtained from its October 2020 Monthly Financial and Operations Report, MFOR.
  
With new private refineries underway, the future of State-owned refineries remains bleak having accounted for high deficit in NNPC’s operations. A good reason to sell, perhaps!
 
While privatization has worked mostly in the telecommunications sector, according to the World Bank, history shows that privatization in Nigeria “reflects some of the problems which have beset many other development processes: lack of political commitment, poor design, insufficient resources, weak management, and corruption”.
  
Already, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has confirmed Nigeria’s many missing target dates for privatisation, attributing such misses to gross underestimation of the challenges of privatization.  Okigbo said: “15 years later, we are back to this idea.  President Obasanjo concluded plans for the sale before he left.  The Yar’Adua government reversed the sale.  We are back to the idea – 15 years later.  I guess it is never too late to start.” Former Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, Joseph Nwakwue, said it was better to hold a minority equity of 49 per cent while 51 per cent should be sold to core investor group that would have technical and financial capacity to revamp and run the refineries. “That to me will address the concerns of both proponents of resource nationalism and free markets,” Nwakwue insisted. According to him, there is no hope that a Nigerian state owned entity could operate any commercial venture successfully. He said Nigeria’s state owned firms don’t have any record in profitably running commercial entities, adding, “the refineries can only be profitably run by private sector.” Program Coordinator – Nigeria Natural Resource Charter, Tengi George-Ikoli noted that being a cost centre, which continues to take significant revenues from Nigeria’s coffers without providing commensurate benefits to the country, adopting a model that would make the country benefit from the assets instead of continually losing was necessary. “The NNPC audit and monthly reports confirmed this as it reported the losses across the refineries,” Gorge-Okoli said while calling for a framework used in the running of the NLNG. She stressed the need to allow private ownership of the assets, but with a stake in the running to benefit from the effective commercial decisions that are taken. “Any arrangement that allows Nigeria to earn rather than lose from retaining ownership and control of the refineries is long overdue,” she added. A Professor of Economics at the Babcock University, Segun Ajibola noted that the only option left for the government to stop the wastes and leakages that the refineries have constituted is to either fully privatise or sell them off altogether.
Ajibola said: “Refinery business should not be a loss-making business. And with the likes of Dangote refinery coming on board, the battle line for fierce competition is drawn. I would rather favour an outright sale of the local refineries to put them in a position where they can compete with other refineries locally and abroad.” He disclosed that the expectations of the proponents of the establishment of local refineries in the 1970s included the refining of crude oil to finished petroleum products such as PMS, AGO, DPK, LPFO and their derivatives to meet local demand and for export. 
To him, such expectations remained a mirage close to fifty years after, as the three major refineries have been bogged down by incessant breakdowns, inefficient and ineffective management, poor accountability among others. 
“It will be the better if the Nigerian government completely takes its hands off the refinery business,” Ajibola said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
