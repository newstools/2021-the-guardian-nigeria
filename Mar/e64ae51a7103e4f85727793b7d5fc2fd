The promo, which will afford some lucky winners all-expense-paid trip to and from Japan, will officially kickoff today. PCN, through their appointed lottery consultant, Isaac Osaikhiwu Isaac of O and I Contact Ltd, said it has an arrangement for NIPOST to distribute and sell the raffle tickets through their different post offices in Abuja, Lagos, Benin, and Ibadan zones, with each ticket selling for N120 naira only. According to PCN President, Brigadier General Emico Eruwa (Rtd), “this raffle promo is being organised to further support the Federal Government’s effort to fund the preparation of the Paralympic contingent to the Tokyo 2020 Games to ensure that our athletes and officials are well equipped in their drive to win more medals for our dear country.” He said sports fans and other enthusiasts around the country can purchase the raffle tickets, which qualifies them for the draw that will enable “the lucky winners make the trip under the terms and conditions of the promo as approved by National Lottery Regulatory Commission.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
