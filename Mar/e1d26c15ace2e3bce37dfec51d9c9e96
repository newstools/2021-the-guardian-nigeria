• Takes on School Outreach in Cameroun, South Africa, Rwanda, Nigeria, The Caribbean From March 18 to 21, 2021 documentary filmmakers from 26 countries will converge on the virtual space to showcase their works to diverse audiences around the world. Sixty films sourced from filmmakers in 26 countries in five of six continents of the world are featuring in the film festival. This is courtesy a collaboration between the Lagos-based iREP Documentary Film Forum/Festival and the US-based African World Documentary Film Festival at the School of Theatre, Television, & Film at San Diego State University. Other collaborators have been drawn from Cameroun, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda and the Caribbean. According to the organisers, as a way of staying in faith with its usual thematic thrust, Africa In Self-Conversation, the entire events – screenings, conversations, lectures, producers’ conventions etc — will happen in the virtual world. “This is occasioned by the prevalent COVID-19 pandemic, which has rendered physical gatherings impossible, especially due to its stringent protocols. The advent of the pandemic had also halted the plan by the Lagos-based iREP to stage its grand 10th anniversary edition in 2020 as the necessitated lockdown was announced on the eve of the starting of the festival. “Through the collaboration of both Lagos-based iREP and San Diego, US-based AWDFF, however, the documentary world will be treated to a feast of flicks that have been carefully curated to reflect the diversities of human experiences through themes that cut across social, cultural and political issues that affect the collective human family,” said the organisers in a joint-statement. “The virtual option has enabled us to harvest films from even greater numbers of countries and filmmakers; and especially the notion of bringing Africa and its diverse Diasporas together has been greatly enabled by the virtual option,” said the iREP programme directorate. Filmmakers participating in the festival have thus been drawn from Africa and its diasporas in the West, Europe and the Caribbean: Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Egypt, Kenya,Uganda, Congo DRC, Sudan, Senegal, Niger, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Botswana; Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Brazil, Mexico, Haiti, Australia. Sixty films in all will be screened, and they cut across human experiences. There are, however, four-star films to be screened in each of the days. The programme directorate said that it had taken a bit of time and meticulous negotiations to convince filmmakers to entrust their work to be screened in a virtual festival, which could be subjected to abuse if not carefully handled. “Even as we get set for the kick-off, we are still in exchange with some of the filmmakers or their agents to give full consent. However, the full security of the films is guaranteed through a screening system that ensures that the copyright and integrity of the films are protected.” According to Femi Odugbemi, Executive Director of iREP, the 2021 edition “is a necessary child of circumstances. In the world we currently inhabit, there is hardly any other way to realise the full potential of an international film festival of our pedigree than to collaborate and cooperate with other organisations with similar objectives. Luckily, we have always been in partnership with the AWDFF in our past 10 editions but we have also expanded to accommodate collaborations from colleagues in Cameroun, Rwanda, South Africa, and The Caribbean.” On why the theme: Africa In Self-Conversation, drawn from the founding conceptual framework of the iREP Documentary Film Forum, is designed to promote awareness about the power of the documentary format to serve as a means of deepening and sharing social and cultural education as well as encouraging participatory democracy in African societies. Significantly, the iREP-AWDFF partnership has enabled the extension of the Festival to university communities across the continent and the diaspora, which had always been the strongest culture of the AWDFF, which started and continued as a university-based festival project. To this extent, the School Outreach scheme will ensure screening and conversation contents attract the interest and participations of students in select campuses in South Africa, Cameroun, Nigeria, Rwanda, USA and The Caribbean. The coordinators of the Outreach who would also act as resource persons during some of the conversation sessions are:
