Parents of 17-year-old Leah Sharibu, who was kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists in 2018, may have lost all hope in the Nigerian government rescuing their daughter. Leah, now rumoured to be mother of two, was on February 19, 2018 kidnapped by Boko Haram alongside over 200 students at her boarding school in Dapchi, Yobe State. When The Guardian visited their residence in Adamawa State, Mr. Nathan Sharibu and his wife, Rebecca, declined comment on the viral media report that Leah just had a second child for her Boko Haram husband in Sambisa Forest. The parents told journalists: “There’s nothing you will hear from us. You can go and write anything you like. We have resigned to fate, since the Federal Government has refused to help us secure the release of our daughter. “We rest our hope in the Lord, no longer in the Nigerian government.” Certainly, this may not be the best time for the Sharibu family, as it was apparent that the family might have heard of the report that Leah was on Tuesday delivered of a baby. Mrs Sharibu, who was met at a hairdressing salon fixing her hair, led journalists to her husband who vented his anger on the reporters.
