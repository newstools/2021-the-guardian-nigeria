The Rotary Club of Eko Atlantic, in collaboration with Ishk Tolaram Foundation, has donated N10 million to support the prostate cancer hospital being constructed at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Ogun State.
 
Speaking to newsmen, president of the club, Vinod Kaurani, said the club members, with the support of the foundation, donated the money as part of its contribution towards ending prostate cancer among Nigerian men.
 
Kaurani said prostate cancer requires more attention than it is getting, adding that though, there are free screenings, the hospital would be a benchmark for effective treatment of prostate cancer in Nigeria, adding that the club would provide more support to ensure the completion of the hospital by June 30, 2021.
