Gbadamossi The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the Lagos East Senatorial bye-election, Mr. Babatunde Gbadamosi, yesterday, appealed against the judgment of the Federal High Court, Lagos, which dismissed their case against the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the election, Senator Tokunbo Abiru. Justice Chuka Obiozor of the Federal High Court had ruled that the case of PDP and Gbadamosi did not disclose grounds for the disqualification of Abiru. In the notice of appeal containing nine grounds and particulars, filed by their counsel, Mr. Peter Ekavwo of Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa law firm, PDP and Gbadamosi are contending that the judge erred in law when he declined jurisdiction to entertain some issues raised on account that they are statute-barred and struck them out. They claimed further that the judge was wrong to have held that the case of the appellants was anchored on nomination of Abiru, whereas it was about statutory disqualification. Furthermore, the appellants claimed that the judge was wrong in striking out the further affidavit of the appellants on the ground that they introduced new issues outside the 14 days allowed by law, whereas they said further affidavit only amplified facts that were already supplied in documents (Form CF001) frontloaded along with the existing originating summon, among others.
