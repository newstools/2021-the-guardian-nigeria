 AfCFTA  Stakeholders have highlighted the importance of public-private partnership (PPP) in boosting Nigeria’s participation in regional and global trade. They also noted that Nigeria’s active involvement in the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) would help to reduce the effect of the current stagflation.
  
They submitted to the ninth edition of the Leadership Excellence for National Development (LEND) webinar and podcast series of the JCI Nigeria Senate Association.
 
The virtual discourse on the risks and rewards of the AfCFTA, was attended by over 125 private, public and civil society professionals from Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Jordan and North America.  While the Nigerian government continues to diversify the productive base of the economy within and beyond the petroleum industries, the emerging free trade across Africa will enable our companies to enhance productivity through competition, specialisation and, eventually, consolidate Nigeria’s hub position in the services sector,” Anatogu noted.
  
Also speaking, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of MainOne, Funke Opeke, observed that the rewards of the continental free trade area would outweigh the risks if the private and public sectors come together to harmonise policy, regulations and business practices.
  
Opeke, whose firm currently has customers in 10 West African countries, listed the key challenges to the AfCFTA implementation in Nigeria to include prevailing predatory trade practices, funding, regulatory and infrastructure constraints, insecurity and productivity issues.
