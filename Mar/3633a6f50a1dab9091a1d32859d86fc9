Fuel Tanker Falls On Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, Shuts Down Road Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu yesterday extolled the harmonious relationship that exists between the executive and legislature leading to monumental infrastructural development in the state. They spoke at the official commissioning of the 1.4 km dual carriageway flyover at Pen Cinema, Agege. Sanwo-Olu said the completion and commissioning of the bridge 648 days after he took over from its initial 20 per cent work done demonstrated what both arms of government can achieve working together. He urged Lagosians to join hands with him as they continue to promote economic prosperity through sustainable road infrastructure all over the state. The Governor, who applauded the residents for their support pledged to continue to improve vehicular movement and traffic flow in the area with the widening of the Ojodu- Berger road to bring relief from the Lagos- Ibadan Expressway. Earlier, special adviser on works and infrastructure, Aramide Adeyoye, said the state would soon commission the completed Ariyo (Mile 10), Ira-Muwo Bridge in Ojo Local Government Area. In related development, the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway was completely shut down after a trailer carrying 33,000 litres of PMS broke down and its tanker dislocated from its bed during recovery. The incident, which happened yesterday, is coming less than two months after two trailers collided on the bridge and one of them filled with diesel burst into flames, damaging the Murtala Mohammed Flyover Bridge. Speaking with The Guardian, an eyewitness claimed that the trailer belonging to MRS without a number plate broke down under the bridge and when LASTMA officials got there, they towed the truck but before getting to Charity bus stop, the tanker disconnected from the trailer bed and the officials abandoned it. When The Guardian got to the scene around 3:30pm, men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were controlling the traffic while Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) officials were there to empty the tanker as well as NUPENG officials but no LASTMA official was sighted. As at the time of filing this report, all efforts to speak with the Public Relations Officer, LASTMA, Olufemi Filade was futile as he refused to speak when called and did not reply to texts sent to him.
