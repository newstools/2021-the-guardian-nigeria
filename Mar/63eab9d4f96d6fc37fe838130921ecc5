 Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN), Dr. Dare Ajiboye  The General Secretary and Chief Executive Officer, Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN), Dr. Dare Ajiboye, made this plea at the announcement of the translation of the English language Bible to Igala and Okun languages. Speaking at the Bible Guest House, Ilupeju, Lagos, Ajiboye emphasised that language is an identity and integral part of the culture of any country including Nigeria, urging governments at all to enforce the usage of local Nigerian languages in schools. He observed that failure to do this will make these language to go into extinction. The BSN boss commended its organisation for making Nigerians read and write in their own languages with the translation of the entire Bible into 26 languages and the New Testament into more than 60 languages. Dr. Ajiboye revealed that some of the books of the Bible have been translated into more than 100 languages, adding that this effort is helping to preserve Nigerian culture and languages and called on government to support the effort. “It is unfortunate BSN has not been receiving any financial assistance from both the Federal and State governments despite its immense contributions to preserve the country’s languages, except for a few individuals who have been of help,” he lamented. He disclosed that the translation of the entire Bible cost at least N72 million, yet BSN, a non-profit-organisation, has to embark on it with contributions made by few people to make Nigerians read the gospel in their own languages.
