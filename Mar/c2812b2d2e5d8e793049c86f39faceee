South Africa Football Association (SAFA) President, Danny Jordan, has tipped Nigeria and his country’s women’s national teams to win the Women World Cup in the nearest future. Jordan, who said the women teams have better chances of succeeding at the Mundial than their male counterparts, added that women football has been on steady growth in both countries. Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg at the weekend, Jordan noted that the women have, over the years, achieved better results in Africa, adding that many Nigerian and South African women have been able to get lucrative contracts with big clubs abroad, which puts them in better positions to compete favourably with their foreign counterparts. He added that African women have been exposed to better structures in Europe where they play for top clubs, saying they now have the technical discipline and ethics to win the World Cup for Africa for the first time. “Nigeria and South Africa have the quality to win the World Cup in the near future. “Super Falcons and Banyana Banyana are among the top three nations in African football in the CAF rankings. With their exploits in the continent and the ability of the players from these countries to get lucrative contracts abroad, they have all they need to match the best Europe and South America can offer.” Jordan called on African football administrators to put their acts together to get the best of their talented women, adding, “playing for big European clubs is an advantage these women have and if properly managed, can see them excel in the World Cup.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
