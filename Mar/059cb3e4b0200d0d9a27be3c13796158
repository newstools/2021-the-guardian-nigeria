Taylor Swift Calls Out Netflix Show ‘Ginny & Georgia’ For Sexist Joke On Monday, Swift called out Netflix and its new drama series Ginny & Georgia in a tweet for a punchline about her in which one character said to another, “You go through men faster than Taylor Swift.” Swift, who has been in a steady and committed relationship for years now, called the joke “lazy” and “deeply sexist.” She also seemed dismayed that Netflix, which is home to both her Reputation Stadium Tour Movie and her documentary film Miss Americana, which presents the star at her most candid and vulnerable, would be OK with broadcasting such a joke at her expense. Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back. How about we stop degrading hard working women by defining this horse shit as FuNnY. Also, @netflix after Miss Americana this outfit doesn’t look cute on you  Happy Women’s History Month I guess pic.twitter.com/2X0jEOXIWp — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) March 1, 2021  This isn’t the first time Swift has spoken out against streaming services that host and profit from her content. She previously had a long-running battle with Spotify, in which she lobbied for artists to be better compensated for their music. Acknowledging her influence, Apple Music reversed its decision not to pay artists whose music was streamed during the free three-month trial period. Ahead of Swift’s tweet on Monday, the phrase “RESPECT TAYLOR SWIFT” had been trending on Twitter all morning in the UK and the US, with fans pointing out the long history of misogynistic scrutiny Swift has endured over her romantic choices. Swift, it turned out, agreed with fans’ interpretation of the joke. “How about we stop degrading hard-working women by defining this horse shit as FuNnY,” she said, pointing out the irony of March being Women’s History Month.
