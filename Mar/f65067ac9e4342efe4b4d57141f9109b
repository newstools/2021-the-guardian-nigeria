The Managing Director of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA), Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, has stated that the establishment of the Cotton and Medical Tourism Parks in Katsina State would bring about the needed improved investment climate to the state. He equally said that the two special economic zones, when fully operational, will change the infrastructure and investment landscape of the state The free zone scheme is a global economic concept that supports speedy infrastructure development, generates both foreign and local direct investments, creates jobs and stimulates local production for exports. Adesugba stressed: “While the Cotton Industrial Park to be sited in Funtau will help in accelerating business activities and bring about competitiveness, the Medical Tourism Park will invariably reduce the huge capital flight and losses through medical tourism. “Our strategic plan is to have the medical parks spread around the six geo-political zones. We are happy with Katsina’s level of commitment towards these projects. The gesture of the state government to earmark 250 hectares for the Cotton Park and 300 hectares for the medical park is already a success story. We would be happier if the Certificates of Occupancy are issued to NEPZA as soon as possible.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
