• Want govt to provide telecoms duct during road construction
• ISPs demand intervention as states give update on facility deployment Fibre operators, especially in the metro space, have called on the Federal Government to grant them pioneer status. This, they claimed, would boost their operations in the country.
 
The call was made by the Chief Marketing Officer, Broad-based Communications, Chidi Ibisi, at a virtually held telecoms forum organised by the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON).
  
Ibisi said the granting of pioneer status, as it was granted to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in the early period of telecommunications revolution in the country, should be extended to operators in the metro space, which, he said, could help ensure 90 per cent broadband coverage of the entire population.  MEANWHILE, subscription statistics released by the NCC at the weekend showed that broadband penetration fell by 0.87 per cent between January and February. But between December 2020 and February 2021, penetration fell by three per cent, moving from 45.02 per cent to 42.06 per cent.
    
Broadband penetration has been on a steep fall since December 2020, with industry watchers putting the blame on the suspension of SIM cards activations and falling standard of living, which is making people to concentrate more on survival.
   
Further from the ATCON seminar, speaking on the realisation of the 2025 broadband target of 70 per cent, the Managing Director and Chief Executive of VDT Communications, Biodun Omoniyi, said the 2025 targets was quite possible, “only if all stakeholders will sync their ideas to achieve it.”
   
According to him, broadband coverage would be better through the wireless infrastructure, as it (broadband) remained key to economic growth. He said ISPs should get government support to enable them remain in business since they contribute to job creation, insisting that protecting them could make broadband services affordable and available.
   
“The Federal Government should look into the challenges facing ISPs, especially their need to access foreign exchange. The Naira has suffered devaluation seriously in a manner that is affecting ISPs and network operators.  It has been devalued for about 250 per cent since six years ago. In 2015, $1 was N150, now it is $1 to N500. This is affecting ISPs seriously,” he stressed.
    
Representing the Chief Executive Officer, MainOne Cables, Funke Opeke, the company’s General Counsel, Yomi Adebanjo, highlighted some of the challenges faced by telecoms operators in achieving broadband penetration and called for the harmonisation of Right of Way (RoW) charges across the board.
