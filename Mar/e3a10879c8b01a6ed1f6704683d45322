If your tax info isn’t provided by May 31st, 2021, Google may be required to deduct up to 24% of your total earnings worldwide.” Earnings made from YouTube Premium, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Channel Memberships will be taxable. A post on Google support page  said YouTube will be going this route because it has a responsibility under Chapter 3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to collect tax info, withhold taxes, and report to the Internal Revenue Service (the U.S. tax authority, also known as the IRS) when a YPP creator on YouTube earns royalty revenue from viewers in the U.S. The content creator platform said if content creator do not provide their tax information by May 31, 2021, Google may be required to deduct up to 24% of their total earnings worldwide. That means for every $100 made on the platform from the US views, Google may deduct up to $24. This, however, applies to all creators outside of the US, including the ones in Nigeria. The new policy would only apply to income earned from viewers within the United States. The Google-owned company said the new policy will take effect as early as June 2021 and urged creators to put submit their tax info before then. YouTube with over 2 billion users worldwide has been a useful platform for anyone with creativity and determination to make money from producing videos. Many creators have made a living from YouTube across the world.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
