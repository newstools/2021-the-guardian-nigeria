The so-called troika of ambassadors heading the World Trade Organization’s three main branches determined after four months of consultations with member states that Okonjo-Iweala was the most likely to obtain the consensus needed to take the top job, paving the way for her to become the first woman and the first African at its helm.

As she menacingly warned: “I’m a fighter; I’m very focused on what I’m doing and relentless in what I want to achieve, almost to a fault. If you get in my way you get kicked.”  Professor Adebajo is the director of the University of Johannesburg’s Institute for Pan-African Thought and Conversation in South Africa.
