Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Too Short, And E-40 Form Hip-Hop Supergroup Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Too Short, and E-40 have joined forces to create a hip-hop supergroup named Mt. Westmore. On Tuesday, Too Short joined DJ Vlad on VladTV where he revealed that the four rappers have already recorded “somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 songs” and will release their debut album next month. Too Short also noted that additional “volumes” will be released in the future. He said: It’s not a thing that we dreamed up; it is a thing that’s really real. This is serious and we did this because we wanted to do some business ventures together and we wanted to join forces to future tour together as well as release these projects… Too Short, 54, went on to explain that he and his fellow group members E-40, 53, Ice Cube, 51, and Snoop, 49, are: at the age where it is a good time to do a thing like this and extend your career a bit in a different way. The minute we join forces, we get a handful of new business opportunities that none of us would have had. The rapper also revealed during an interview with HipHopDX in February that Dr. Dre will be featured on the group’s new album as well as how they all interact. We gave each other the authority to criticize, critique, veto, make suggestions, and just everything is like hands-down, I trust what you saying. It literally has been said, ‘Bro, that verse you spit yesterday was wack’ and then bro go back and redo that verse, and like, ‘You came with it this time.’ Too Short first shared details of the supergroup during an appearance on the podcast Serch Says. He said: During the quarantine I got a call from Ice Cube and E-40 going, ‘Man I feel like we should do an album like me you E40, Cube, Too Short and Snoop Dogg.’ And I’m like… ‘E-40 and Too Short are from the Bay, Snoop Dogg and Cube are from L.A. and we are like the West Coast foundation.’ We sat there and was like, ‘F— it, let’s do it.’ So, we start coming up with beats.’
