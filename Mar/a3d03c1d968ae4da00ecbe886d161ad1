I’ve stopped recording 2021 ”. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1369744 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1869" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1.jpg 680w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1-410x598.jpg 410w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1-381x557.jpg 381w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1-164x240.jpg 164w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1-329x480.jpg 329w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skepta-retirement-2021-1-411x600.jpg 411w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The news comes as a shock for many of the rapper’s fans after he revealed last year that he was working on a new album. Speaking on Instagram Live in May, he said: “I’m making my album now, you get me, before I stop. I’m making my album now before I stop banging out all the beats.” The Mercury Prize winner’s last solo album was “Ignorance Is Bliss” which was released in 2019. Skepta is one of the most influential people in the UK. Originally a DJ from Tottenham-based grime collective Meridian Crew, he began MCing shortly before the group disbanded in 2005. He and his younger brother Jme then joined the British grime group Roll Deep for a short period of time before becoming founding members of Boy Better Know in 2005. His debut studio album, Greatest Hits, was released to much acclaim in 2007, while he followed up in 2009 with Microphone Champion. The three-time Brit Award nominee also released studio album “Doin’ It Again” in 2011. Then came the multi-award-winning Konnichiwa in 2016. In 2020, Skepta joined British rappers Chip and Young Adz for a collaborative album called “Insomnia”.
