As we are still experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, I would like remind the public on the COVID-19 symptoms to facilitate the early care seeking when we experience the symptoms. It has to be noted that COVID-19 affects people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and tiredness, while in some patients it presents with aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes. When one has these symptoms, there is need to have a COVID-19 test. If one experiences the following serious symptoms ofdifficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, loss of speech or movement, immediate medical attention is needed. It is important to note that early care seeking lead to positive treatment outcomes. Lastly, on COVID-19 Vaccination, let me emphasize that the AstraZeneca vaccine which we are using is safe as it has less or fewer side effects. Most of them are minor and self-limiting and these include pain or soreness on the injection site, fever, headache, muscle or joint pain, fatigue or nausea. These will usually go away without any need of hospital treatment.People receiving the vaccine are informed on the possible side effects of the vaccine including those that may require to be immediately reported to the health authorities or facilities. Those that have or will be receiving the vaccine are encouraged to report to nearest health facility any adverse effects following immunization or call toll free number 929. It is important to note that reporting adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccine supports continuous monitoring of the safe and effective use of the vaccine in our country. No one is safe until everyone else is safe. Protect yourself. Protect your loved ones. Protect everyone. Call toll free 929. Hon. Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, MP
