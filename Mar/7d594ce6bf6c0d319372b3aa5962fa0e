The express booklets can be accessed at the cost of N20, 000 within three days but for those who wish to get it within 24 hours, they would be charged N30, 000. In a communique issued from the office of the public relations officer of the service, Sunday James, minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, said the new center is aimed at ensuring that individuals procure passports almost immediately in situations of urgency.
