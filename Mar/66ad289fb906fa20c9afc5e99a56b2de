Aspiring basketballers in the North-East zone have been presented an opportunity to learn from the masters following an agreement by the Adamu Yola Ture Foundation and the Jordan Nwora Foundation to hold a three-day camp in Gombe. The camp, which has Adidas as the official kits company, will hold from April 9 to 11, 2021. The organisers at the weekend disclosed that the camp is designed for young boys and girls between the ages of 14 to 19 from the six northeast states of the country. According to Pastor Yakubu Adamu Yola, who is the coordinator of the biggest football tournament in the whole of the northeast and doubles as the organiser of the camp, it is part of the foundation’s commitment to creating opportunities to empower young basketballers from their zone. “I am very delighted to say that the Foundation has agreed on terms with Jordan Nwora Foundation for a Junior Basketball Camp for the entire North-East states. The major benefit of the camp is to give American Basketball/Education Scholarship opportunities to outstanding campers,” he stated. Yola added that his foundation is committed to ensuring that young people from the North East have the same opportunities youths from other parts of the country enjoy, adding, “we have agreed to host 60 boys, 40 girls, nine male, and seven females coaches in the three-day event. “The Ministry of Youths and Sports of all the six northeast states are glad that this golden opportunity to develop basketball in the zone is coming earlier than expected.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
