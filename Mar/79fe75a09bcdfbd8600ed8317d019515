Air Peace airline is set to resume daily flight operations on the Lagos-Accra route, effective March 15, 2021. The airline said the regional travel that had been on hold since the outbreak of coronavirus last year, was strategic to connectivity in West Africa. Similarly, the airline has expressed readiness to kick-off scheduled flights into Ilorin from Abuja and Lagos. The spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said that the resumption of Accra flights was a response to the popular demand of the flying public. “You would recall that we suspended our Accra flights consequent upon the pandemic lockdown last year. But we have some exciting news for our esteemed customers as we are resuming flight operations into the Ghanaian city soon. The flying public has been expectant of this,” he said. Olisa, who added that the airline was finalising plans to commence Ilorin flights soon, reiterated Air Peace’s commitment to providing safe connectivity across domestic, regional and international destinations and satisfying the air travel needs of Nigerians. Air Peace is an indigenous airline servicing 16 domestic routes, five regional routes and two international destinations, including Johannesburg, and has a varied fleet of 26 aircraft comprising the ultra-modern Embraer 195-E2 jet, Boeing 777, Embraer 145, Boeing 737 and Dornier 328 jet.
