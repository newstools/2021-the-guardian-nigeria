Yakasai Nigerian Youth Forum (NYF) has called on government authorities that detained Salihu Yakasai, former aide to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, to immediately release him or face the consequences. Describing Yakasai as its founding member, the forum said his arrest by the State Security Service (SSS) was unjustifiable. President of NYF, Abdulsalam Kazeem, while demanding Yakasai’s release, said his arrest while exercising his fundamental right was against the principle of modern democracy. “The leadership of Unified Nigerian Youth Forum (UNYF), also known as NYF, condemns in strong terms the unlawful arrest of one of her founding members, Mallam Salihu Tanko Yakasai, over his personal opinion on the serial kidnapping of school children and other security challenges facing the nation. “Democracy, the world over, recognises criticism. Activists, civil society and opposition members over time have equally used criticism as tools to checkmate government, thereby putting government back on the right track,” he said. The group appealed to the Director-General of Department of State Services, Alhaji Yusuf Magaji, to act professionally and within the rule of law on the unlawful arrest of Yakasai. “Public affairs analysts rated him high when it comes to professionalism on such sensitive issues, and as such we hope and believe that Yakasai will not stay longer than necessary in detention,” he concluded.
