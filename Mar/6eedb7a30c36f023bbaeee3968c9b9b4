 [FILES] Water project  The Minister of Water Resources, Alhaji Suleiman Adamu had announced on Feb. 17 that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had approved a review of the contract for the project. The project was abandoned in 2007 at 30 per cent completion level. Fika told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Damaturu that the recent resumption of work on the site could not have happened without intense lobbying by the senator. “You will hardly be proved wrong, if you loudly shout to say Fika is probably the only local government area in Yobe without potable water. “This predicament is suffered by all the inhabitants along Fika and Gadaka, who our senator will now save from drinking muddy water, drawn from Fika shallow seasonal streams. “People desperately search for water through digging of wells and drilling of boreholes which in most cases prove abortive. “By this action, the distinguished senator has joined the league of the most successful sons and daughters of this land who have immensely impacted on the lives of the people. “He has also written his name in gold, and by the grace of the Almighty Allah, we will reciprocate this gesture with our ballots, support and encouragement,” he said. The forum chairman also commended Yobe governor, Mai Mala-Buni for his efforts towards continuation of the project and other projects that had direct bearing to the lives of the people. Fika assured the contractor, Atlantic Drilling Fluid Services Nigeria Ltd, of support of the communities for successful completion of the project. NAN reports that the forum is a group of technocrats, community leaders and elders of Fika, who always contribute their quota to its socio-economic development.
