 Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Photo: VON  At the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 175.56 points or 0.44 per cent to close at 39,522.06 points. Accordingly, investors lost N92 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N20.678 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, including MTN Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, International Breweries, Dangote Sugar Refinery and Oando. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We expect the sell-off to continue due to increasing rates in the fixed income market. However, the current prices of stocks make an attractive case for dividend yields.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage firm said: “Void of any positive event capable of lifting investors’ confidence, the bears continued to dominate the domestic bourse amidst persistent sell pressure on major bellwether stocks. Given the negative market breadth, as well as the unimpressive sectoral performances, we expect the bearish tone to filter into tomorrow’s session.” Market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was negative as 30 stocks lost, relative to 16 gainers.
