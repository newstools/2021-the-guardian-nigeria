 Kingsley Moghalu  The Elevating Youth Voices virtual summit, which is scheduled to hold on April 10, 2021 with the theme “The Creative Industry, Social Media, and Governance,” will examine how cultural “influencers” can move beyond social bubbles and utilise their voices and influence to bring about improved governance in the country at large. It will also discuss the increasingly important role of social media in Nigerian national life, and its potential to shape governance and public policy in positive ways. According to a statement, several A-List artistes and youth influencers will serve as speakers during the event. They include entertainment entrepreneur Jude (“M.I.”) Abaga, actress, former beauty queen and good governance activist, Regina Askia Williams, the on-air personality Sandra Ezekwesili, actress Kate Henshaw, the actor Benjamin Joseph, and the poet, essayist and Daily Trust columnist Gimba Kakanda. Others are the youth social entrepreneur Hamzat (“Hamzy Code”) Lawal, notable #EndSARS personalities Modupe Odele, Rinu Oduola and DJ Switch, the technology lawyer Timi Olagunju, and the actress Rahama Sadau. Andrew Mwavua, a United States entrepreneur, and Matilda Duncan, an on-air personality, will serve as the summit’s moderators. “We all worry about what the future holds for Nigeria’s youth in the face of rising poverty, insecurity and unemployment, but it is now time for responsible action. “We plan to have a deep-dive conversation between young people to explore how the gap between the celebrity influence and the difficult realities of life in our country can be bridged,” Moghalu said.
