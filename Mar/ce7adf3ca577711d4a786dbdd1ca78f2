The Institute of Strategic Entrepreneurs of Nigeria (ISEN) has stressed the urgent need for the Federal Government to adopt entrepreneurship models to stimulate national growth.
 
The institute also called on the government to create easy access to funding and a favourable business environment for entrepreneurs.
 
Director, Training and Membership, ISEN, Dr. Albert Ndeze, said this at the institute’s induction lecture and fellowship award at the weekend in Lagos.  “The Federal Government of Nigeria has recognised me as Nigeria Scientist of note, while the Abia State Government has attested to provision of land for a proposed refinery and my Local Government, Umuahia South confirmed provision of land for my Grace University of Technology.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
