 Pinnick. Photo: SPORTSHINDU  Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President Amaju Pinnick hopes to pick not less than 40 votes out of the 53 in today’s FIFA Council election in Rabat, Morocco, if the projection by NFF Secretary General, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, is anything to go by.
 
The 43rd Ordinary General Assembly of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) holds today with 14 candidates contesting for six seats allocated to the continent in the FIFA Council. There are 37 members in the exalted chamber of football’s world governing body.
 
The Guardian learnt yesterday that two candidates out of five in the Anglophone zone stepped down for the Nigerian candidate, Pinnick, yesterday. The five countries are Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and The Gambia.  The identities of the candidates that stepped down for Pinnick were not disclosed yesterday. If Pinnick, who has the backing of President Muhammadu Buhari succeeds in the venture, he will be the third Nigerian to occupy the post after the Late Etubom Oyo Orok Oyo and Dr. Amos Adamu. MEANWHILE, South African billionaire, Patrice Motsepe, is expected to be elected as CAF president with rival candidates, Senegal’s Augustin Senghor, Ahmed Yahya (Mauritania) and Jacques Anouma (Ivory Coast) assuming two vice-presidential roles and a special advisor role respectively.  Motsepe, who does business in 40 African countries, also insists on being seen as a unifying candidate who values fair play. If he is elected CAF president today, Motsepe is expected to withdraw from Mamelodi Sundowns to devote his body and soul to his new position.
