Managing the affairs of a financial institution at this time is a yeoman’s job. The best bankers in the world will affirm this. For Yemisi Edun, the acting Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), there couldn’t have been a better time to be called to manage the affairs of the brand. She has proved her mettle just a few months after taking over from the former managing director, Adam Nuru. Like the seasoned professional she is, the banker par excellence rose to the occasion, confirming the words of Stephen Covey: “I am not a product of my circumstances; I am a product of my decisions.” Since assuming her new appointment from being an Executive Director of the bank, Yemisi has shown her wealth of experience, effectively taking charge of the bank she joined in 2000 as Divisional Head of Internal Audit and Control before rising to the position of Chief Financial Officer.
