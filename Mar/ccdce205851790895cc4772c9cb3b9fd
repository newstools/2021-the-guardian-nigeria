Great were the thoughts that went into establishing Mission Schools. Noble were the exertions, labour and sacrifice that went into giving Nigeria foundational materials for human capital development, which provided the building blocks for our social and economic development, cultivation of refinement and civilization.

This cannot be appreciated until we run our eyes through the list. Step forward CMS Grammar School, Lagos. The oldest secondary school in Nigeria, it was founded on 06 June, 1859.
