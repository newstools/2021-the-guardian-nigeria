Fuel scarcity looms in Anambra State following Independent Petroleum Marketers Association (IPMAN), Enugu Depot’s 14-day ultimatum to the state government to fulfill the agreement with the association or face marketers’ showdown. IPMAN expressed displeasure at the delay to pay one of its members, Siluch Oil and Gas Limited the N13.5 million for Automotive Gas Oil supplied to the state government through the Transport Company of Anambra State (TRACAS) since 2017. The association gave the ultimatum in Awka yesterday, in a notice endorsed by its Chairman, Chinedu Anyaso and and Secretary Oliver Ekwueme and addressed to Governor Willie Obiano. Anyaso, who said copies were also sent to the police, DSS, NSCDC and other security agencies, expressed their displeasure over the refusal to provide necessary documents for a parcel of land allocated to them for a Petroleum Tankers Park in the state as contained in the memorandum of understanding (MoU) of August 2020. Citing letters, which culminated meeting between government and representatives of IPMAN and which produced a joint communiqué dated August 4, 2020 with reference number: ANS/SSG/M.4301/T.1/105, the group expressed concern over failure to keep its promise to pay N13.5 million, being the value of diesel Siluch Oil & Gas Limited supplied to the state government. While appreciating the state government for giving marketers the land for the petroleum tankers park in Anambra, IPMAN added: “We however, wish to draw your attention on the need to execute necessary documents including issuance of C of O to your ministry of transport and execution of government’s presence at the designated premises. “We have resolved to use necessary measures that borders on withdrawal of our services to Anambra State to sensitise government to do the needful within the timeline. In reaction, Special Adviser to Governor Obiano on NUPENG Petroleum and Union Matters, Peter Nwosu, said government received the letter and was working to avert IPMAN threat. He said Obiano had approved the land, but the Ministry of Lands would make it available with necessary documentation and that the Ministry of Transport was working on its indebtedness to Siluch Oil.
