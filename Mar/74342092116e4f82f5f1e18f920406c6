Ms Omolara Omotayo (not real name) works with a Lagos state ministry in Alausa. On February 5, she was driving to the airport road from Isolo axis with a Ford Jeep, which she had borrowed from her friend. Unknown to her, the bridge to airport road had been closed following a tanker explosion that burnt part of the bridge on January 7, 2021. National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) had stated that integrity tests would be carried out on the bridge before the route could be reopened. Unfortunately, the authorities are still carrying out their so-called integrity test, two months after, on the bridge, which leads to the busiest airport in Nigeria, while citizens bemoan their fate. Wondering how to connect to the airport road, Omotayo continued to head towards Oshodi until she got in front of the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) office, where a group of boys told her to take the bridge leading outwards fro the airport, which is a one-way. The motorist was arrested and taken to LASTMA office.
  
She said: “I was taken to LASTMA office, where I was told to use POS to withdraw money to give them. After prolonged and exhaustive pleadings, they agreed to take N30, 000. I was lucky to pay N30, 000 before my car was released to me because I saw others who paid as much as N120, 000. What surprised me the most was that those officers were hiding in a bus and watching people directing us to take that one-way. Obviously, they were the ones who stationed those touts there to misdirect us so they could extort us.
  
“Instead of them hiding with uniforms in the car, and waiting for people to fall victim, they can as well use the same uniform to direct people where to pass. They allowed Danfo to pass the bridge because they knew private car owners would follow them. My major concern is their staying in a corner and seeing touts telling people to take that route. It is definitely a set up.”  The Vice Chair who is also the Chair of the Branch’s Human Rights Committee passionately appealed to the Judiciary to establish at least two mobile courts to cover the Epe and Ibeju-Lekki axis. She further noted that arresting suspects from Epe and taking them to Oshodi to face trial is unjust. “In the same vain, it is unfair to have lawyers travel all the way from Epe to Oshodi to provide legal services to these suspects,” she added.
  
Adebayo Akinlade, who was a former chairman of the NBA Ikorodu wondered why a mobile court is located in one place? “Is Justice served by gathering suspects from all over Lagos and taking them to a central location to be prosecuted? What impact does this have in the spread of COVID-19? ” He asked? Akinlade stated that a lawyer who tried to represent a suspect at the mobile court was told to go and get a written approval from the Attorney General to be able to represent the defendant, and that since the court has lawyers from the Office of Public Defender (OPD), any other lawyer including the Legal Aid Council would not be granted access nor right of appearance.
  
He said: “I was further informed that even one of the magistrates insisted they can’t appear since they are not from the OPD. The question is: what are they all hiding? Since when does a lawyer require the approval and or consent of the Attorney General (AG) to defend a matter, when the counsel is not a foreigner nor from a foreign country? Why must the OPD lawyer be imposed on a defendant against a lawyer of his own choice in breach of the provisions of the Constitution? Is there a conspiracy to cover up something?”  The Public Relations Officer (PRO) for LASTMA, Olumide Filade. said LASTMA will not aid driving against traffic popularly known as one-way in any way. According to him, officials arrest commercial vehicles that ply one-way on the Apakun Bridge. “The allegation likely emanated from private vehicle drivers hoping to engender public sympathy. Recall the SUV driver that knocked down over the bridge, a police officer attached to LASTMA for security purposes about two weeks ago. His case is already in court and he’s been remanded in Badagry prison. “Also recall that the General Manager of LASTMA, Olajide Oduyoye has a video trending where he warned motorists to desist from plying one-way on the bridge, while he also personally apprehended a yellow commercial bus on the bridge after that,” he told The Guardian. On the allegation of collecting money through POS, Filade said the agency has investigated several reported cases diligently without any concrete proof of LASTMA officers owning POS, but added “we cannot disprove the possibility of collaboration with outsiders. Also note that we have some dismissed officers still impersonating. We are surreptitiously investigating, while one has been arrested, to face the full wrath of the law soon.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
