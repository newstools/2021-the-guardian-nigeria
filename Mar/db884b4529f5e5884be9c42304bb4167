 [files] USAID  The funding increases the total U.S. assistance to Nigeria to $2.16 billion under the five-year Development Objectives Assistance Agreement (DOAG) signed between USAID and the Ministry of Finance. “With this notification, the United States deepens its commitment to Nigeria in meeting its development challenges,” said USAID Acting Mission Director Katie Donohoe.  “We will continue to support improved health, nutrition, economic growth, good governance, and human rights.” Most of the new funding, more than $115 million, will finance new and existing activities to improve public health in Nigeria, including $40 million for maternal and child health, $28 million to control malaria, as well as significant boosts in family planning, tuberculosis control, nutrition, and pandemic relief. Another $32 million will be for economic growth, including $19 million to help Nigeria increase agricultural productivity and access to nutritious foods, $10.5 million for cleaner water, and two million to facilitate trade and investment. An additional $15.5 million in basic education funds will expand states’ abilities to provide early grade reading programs and alternative education opportunities for out-of-school children and youth while addressing the marginalization and educational needs of Nigeria’s hearing-impaired community. Finally, $6 million will go towards new activities to strengthen human rights, civil society organizations, political competition and consensus-building, and reducing trafficking in persons.
