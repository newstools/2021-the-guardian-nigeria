In a statement, PSG said that Brazil forward Neymar “will continue his individual training”, saying that a new assessment would be made “in the coming days”. The 29-year-old had begun training with the squad again last week but will not return in time for Wednesday’s last 16, second leg clash with his former club at the Parc des Princes. Neymar has been out of action since mid-February after picking up the thigh injury in PSG’s French Cup victory over Caen. The injury meant he also missed the first leg at the Camp Nou, which PSG won 4-1. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
