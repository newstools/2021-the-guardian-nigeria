Oscars Nomination: ‘Mank’ Leads In Record Year For Women “Mank,” David Fincher’s black-and-white ode to “Citizen Kane,” comfortably led this year’s Oscars nominations Monday with 10 nods including for best picture and best director, as female filmmakers and streamers smashed Academy records. The Netflix reimagining of Hollywood’s Golden Age was far ahead of the competition following the announcement, which saw six films receive six nominations apiece including US road movie “Nomadland” and anti-Vietnam War courtroom drama “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” In a year that saw a record 70 women nominated, there were directing nods for Chloe Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”), the first year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has ever selected multiple women in the category. The nominations narrow the field to the final hopefuls for April 25, the latest ever date for Hollywood’s award season-capping spectacle which has been transformed and delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Zhao is the first woman of color ever nominated as director, while Aaron Sorkin (“Chicago 7”) had to settle for a screenplay nomination after missing out to the likes of Fincher and Danish director Thomas Vinterberg (“Another Round.”) The Academy awarded a historically diverse field, including six nods to civil rights drama “Judas and the Black Messiah” featuring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield, and a first Asian-American best actor nod for Steven Yuen in Korean-American immigrant drama “Minari.” The other films tied in second with six nominations were Amazon’s “Sound of Metal,” about a rock drummer who loses his hearing, and harrowing dementia chronicle “The Father”, which saw former winner Anthony Hopkins bag a sixth career acting nod. Ahead of the nominations announcement, Academy president David Rubin confirmed this year’s Oscars would be broadcast from Los Angeles’ cavernous Union Station as well as its traditional Dolby Theatre home in Hollywood. Celebrity couple Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas then read out the nominees in a live-stream from London.
