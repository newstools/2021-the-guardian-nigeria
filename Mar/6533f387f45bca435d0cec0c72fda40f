Community leaders in Akinsany Street, Ojodu area, have urged women to seek education to end girl child trafficking in Nigeria. The leaders spoke in commemoration of the International Women’s Day, hosted by CLEEN Foundation, to raise awareness on the rights of women and outdated norms and practices that impede the growth of females and girls in Nigeria. According to the chairman of Akinsanya Street Community Development Association, Ojodu, Prince Emmanuel Ajiwole, women should seek education to know what is right when it comes to trafficking of women. “For those who cannot go to school to learn and become great in the corporate world, they can go into business and be independent.” he said. Once you are able to take care of yourself, you will not fall victim of girl trafficking.”He charged the government to give more resources to tackling the culture of silence, sexual violence and low women representation in politics and governance in the country. According to the Head of Office, CLEEN Foundation, Lagos, Blessing Abiri, “This year’s international women’s day provides a laudable moment to speak and challenge the exclusion and marginalisation of women and girls, also to seek gender equality in the community.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
