 Bridget Chigbufue  Themed African Royalty, the evening saw leading celebrities turn up to the red carpet looking fabulous and regal in the best African attires we have seen this year. Hosted by Nollywood star Beverly Naya, the stars slayed the theme to perfection, showing up and out. A night of glitz, glam, beauty and fashion, the premiere red carpet was graced with outstanding styles and mind-blowing fashion pieces that brought the theme to life, all thanks to creative designers and stylists. The highly anticipated feature film which is a sequel to the Hollywood classic Coming To America starring Eddie Murphy, as well as Nigerian actor, singer, and model, Rotimi, was officially released globally on Amazon Prime and is open nationwide in Nigerian cinemas from west African film company, FilmOne Entertainment. It is no gainsaying that our faves came through, going all out as the African royals that they are and you should definitely take a look at every outfit they rocked. Which look is inspiring your next fashion statement? <img loading="lazy" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-480x598.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1362981 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-480x598.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-924x1152.jpg 924w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-447x557.jpg 447w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-894x1114.jpg 894w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-193x240.jpg 193w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-385x480.jpg 385w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam-481x600.jpg 481w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Elozonam.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-478x598.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1362976 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-921x1152.jpg 921w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-891x1114.jpg 891w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2-480x600.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daala-Oruwari-2.jpg 1079w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-478x598.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="598" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1362973 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-922x1152.jpg 922w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-446x557.jpg 446w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-891x1114.jpg 891w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1-480x600.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chioma-Ikokwu-2-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /> To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
