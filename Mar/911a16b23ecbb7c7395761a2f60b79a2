After defeating Mountain of Fire Miracle Ministries FC (MFM) of Lagos 2-0 in Port Harcourt, and also earning a draw against Plateau United in their last match, Rivers United coach, Stanley Eguma, is confident that his team would pick a point against Lobi Stars FC in today’s Nigeria Professional League (NPFL), at Aper Aku Stadium, Makurdi. Eguma stated that the impressive results of Rivers United so far in the NPFL would propel his players to work hard to get back to the top of the league table, which the team occupied at the early stage. “Earning points in every game comes as a relief to get Rivers United back on track and also a chance to start the process of climbing up the league table. The team need to fashion out a well tailored strategy and tactics that will be able to overcome Lobi Stars as the ‘Pride of Rivers’ hope not to drop any point in Makurdi,” he said. Rivers United are currently in the sixth position in NPFL league log with 26 points from 15 matches, while their opponent, Lobi Stars FC, tutored by Kabiru Dogo, have won three games and lost three of their last six matches in the NPFL.
