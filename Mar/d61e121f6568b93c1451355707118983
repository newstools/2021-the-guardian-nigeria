A message posted on Facebook in Nigeria claims that the “antiseptic, antibacterial and antiviral properties” of lemon juice will cure ear problems known as otitis. “HOW TO TREAT OTITIS WITH LEMON,” it begins. “Lemon is known for its antiseptic, antibacterial and antiviral properties. It is very suitable for pain in the ear due to otitis. To relieve it, choose an organic lemon, squeeze it, and collect 2 drops of lemon juice to put twice a day in the sore ear.” Otitis media is inflammation or infection located in the middle ear. It can occur as a result of a cold, sore throat, or respiratory infection. But can lemon juice be used to treat otitis?  “It makes no sense to me. The claim is wrong. Lemon juice is not a treatment for otitis media,” Samuel Adoga, a professor of ear, nose, throat, head and neck surgery at Nigeria’s University of Jos told Africa Check. “My advice to anyone battling with this issue is to see an expert – an ear, nose and throat doctor. Treatment may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem. Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection.” Adoga said a specialist ear, nose and throat doctor might recommend surgery, if the patient’s infection didn’t respond to treatment or if the patient had recurrent ear infections.
