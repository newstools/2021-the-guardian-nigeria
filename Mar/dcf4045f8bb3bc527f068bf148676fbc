Drake – Scary Hours 2 Drake has released the new Scary Hours 2 EP. The three-track project opens with “What’s Next,” the Lil Baby assisted “Wants and Needs” and “Lemon Pepper Freestyle,” featuring Rick Ross. “What’s Next” is accompanied by a music video directed by Theo Skudra. The Scary Hours 2 pack is composed of three bar-heavy tracks, all of which address the unending demands of life as one of the most influential artists of his generation. On “Wants and Needs”, which features Lil Baby, Drake posits himself above the conjecture of the general public, asking us to “leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense”. On the Rick Ross collaboration “Lemon Pepper Freestyle”, Drake laments, “These days fame is disconnected from excellence.” Then there is “What’s Next”, where he broaches the incessant speculation about his time away from the limelight: “Summer, all I did was rest, okay? And New Year’s, all I did was stretch, okay? And Valentine’s Day, I had sex, okay? We’ll see what’s about to happen next, okay?” Stream “Scary Hours 2” below:  Drake’s sixth studio album Certified Lover Boy is due out sometime in 2021. CLB was originally slated to drop in January but it was postponed. “I was planning to release my album this month but between surgery and rehab my energy has been dedicated to recovery,” Drake wrote in an Instagram story in January. “I’m blessed to be back on my feet feeling great and focused on the album, but CLB won’t dropping in January. I’m looking forward to sharing it with you all in 2021.” On OVO Sound Radio Drake offered an update without giving a specific release date. “CLB is currently being chef’d in every way possible,” he said, noting that he’s been working with his regular collaborators Noel Cadastre and Noah “40” Shebib. “I don’t have an exact date, but it’s in the pot and it’s coming soon.”
