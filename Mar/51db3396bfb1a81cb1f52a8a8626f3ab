 Ayo Daniels<br />  Marriage is a covenant relationship between a man, woman and God, the author of marriage, which is binding for life. Marriage is the commitment of two people of the opposite sex to the person of Jesus Christ and to one another without fear of intimidation. Marriage is a pledge of mutual fidelity and submission. Faithfulness and loyalty are the keywords grafted in that submission. Each party see one another as joint-heirs of God’s grace, which empowers their love, honour and submission to God, one another in the marriage. None see either party as inferior to others but treating themselves as joint heirs to the grace of God, contributing to the strength and character of their home ((Ecclesiastes 4:9-12; I John 4:18). For anyone to enjoy marriage as God intended it, we must be open enough to embrace the biblical model as an essential building block to build stable families in society. Kingdom marriage has a divine blueprint (God Factor), the union of two humans (male and female) and covenant relationship (of till death do us part) Eph. 5:21-31.
