Mr Jeremiah Mashat, the Operational Controller of DPR Field Operation’s Office in Jalingo, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Maahat said that the department had directed its team to monitor compliance and sanction erring operators appropriately. According to him, petrol must be sold at the official prices of between N162 and N165. He, however, commended IPMAN in the state for cooperating with the DPR in the area of compliance to regulations governing the downstream sector. “We are insisting that marketers should not sell petroleum products above the approved pump prices. “We have sent our team to the field to monitor compliance and ensure enforcement where there is a violation. “We must ensure that marketers comply with regulations and the public is not shortchanged as far as petroleum downstream sector is a concern,’’ he said.
