Nigerian ports are set for better efficiency as a major crane manufacturer, Konecranes, unveiled plans to deliver two eco-efficient Gottwald Model 7 Mobile Harbor Cranes to Tincan Island Container Terminal Limited (TICT) in Lagos. According to Konecranes, the order, booked in January, showed its commitment to helping customers and industries to transform and run more efficiently, sustainably and safely. The new cranes, which will be delivered in August 2021, will help TICT to accommodate larger vessels. Managing Director, TICT, Etienne Rocher, said: “Liner requirements are constantly evolving, increasingly requiring higher performance cranes with flexibility in cargo handling and twin-lift container operation as larger ships call more frequently at our port. Our experience with Konecranes equipment has always been excellent. We are pleased to add two more of the Model 7 cranes to our facility.” Regional Sales Manager for Konecranes Port Solutions, Andreas Czwalinna, said: “These cranes will bring the number of the TICT Konecranes Gottwald mobile harbor crane fleet to 12, giving TICT the capacity to reduce vessel port stay through improved operational efficiency. This order illustrates the strength of our long-term partnership with Bolloré, working with them at their facilities around the world as they continue to grow,” The new cranes will be operated by TICT in the Tincan area of the Port of Lagos, where they will handle containers alongside a fleet of six Model 4, two Model 6 and two Model 7 Konecranes Gottwald mobile harbor cranes already on-site.
