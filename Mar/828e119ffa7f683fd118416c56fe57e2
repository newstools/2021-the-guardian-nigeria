Emma Ibru explains why AS Racine FC opted out of 2021 NLO zonal elimination 
Another Nigerian coach, Remmy Amadi, has been handed a two-year ban and his team, Cofine FC of Rivers State, thrown out of the ongoing 2021 National League One (NLO) in Calabar zone of the competition over alleged match-fixing. Following allegations of match fixing against Amadi, the NLO Secretariat set up a panel in Calabar zone to ascertain the veracity of the charges. In a circular dated March 15, and addressed to the concerned parties, and host FA, the NLO Secretariat acknowledged the receipt of the report and decision of the panel. The NLO stated that the allegations of match fixing against Coach Remmy Amadi of Cofine FC was ‘very grievous offence,’ which can bring the game to disrepute. The NLO therefore invoked the relevant rules of the tournament, including a fine of N500, 000 on Cofine FC, Rivers State, all results of their matches in the ongoing 2021 NLO season cancelled (it is assumed that all previous matches played were through match fixing). Coach Remmy Amadi, who is the mastermind of the act, banned for a period of two years. The NLO also warned clubs to desist from desperate moves to qualify for promotion, insisting that it would not tolerate any act of misconduct before, during and after every game. Meanwhile, the proprietor of AS Racine FC, Emma Ibru has explained his club’s decision to stay away from the ongoing 2021 National League One (NLO) zonal matches. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Emma Ibru, who is one of the longest club financiers in the country, said the short notice from the NLO secretariat in Abuja for teams to prepare for the zonal qualifiers made it difficult for his club to put all necessary logistics in place. “We decided not to participate this year because of the logistics involved. We got the information late. We will play next year,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
