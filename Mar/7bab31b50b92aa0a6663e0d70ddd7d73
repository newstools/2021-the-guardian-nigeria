A message posted on Facebook in Nigeria claims that avocado seed powder will treat high blood pressure, prevent cancer and reduce “excessive sugar”. “Get 4 seeds of English pear (Avocado pear), cut into pieces, dry under the sun and grind into powder,” it reads. “Put a teaspoon of this powder into your prepared palp and drink. Once daily for 2 weeks.  It’s anti cancer and Excessive sugar reduction tool.” High blood pressure, known as hypertension, is a serious medical condition that can increase the risk of heart, kidney, brain and other diseases. It affects about 1.13 billion people worldwide. The World Health Organization says countries in its African Region together have the world’s highest prevalence of hypertension, at 27%. But is powdered avocado really a remedy for hypertension and an “anti-cancer and excessive sugar reduction tool”? We checked.  <img class="align-center lazyload" src="https://africacheck.org//sites/default/files/inline-images/avocados_incorrect.png" alt="avocado_incorrect" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fd814dba-3b2f-4d1e-9122-3515353800cb" />  We asked Casimir Omuemu, a professor of medicine at the University of Benin in southern Nigeria, if the claims in the Facebook post were correct. “This combination has no proven efficacy and I would not advise anyone to even try it,” he said. According to the UK’s National Health Service, high blood pressure can be controlled by lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise. Some people may also have to take medicine. And the WHO says people diagnosed with hypertension should measure their own blood pressure with automated devices. It’s also important to be evaluated by a health professional for an assessment of risk and associated conditions. Africa Check has debunked a similar claim that a combination of spices is able to cure high blood pressure. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
