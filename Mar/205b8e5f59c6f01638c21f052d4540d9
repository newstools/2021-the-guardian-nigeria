Kidnap attacks on ships for ransom have become common occurences in the Gulf of Guinea which runs from Senegal to Angola, taking in the southwest coast of Nigeria. The perpetrators are usually Nigerian pirates. The Gulf of Guinea accounted for more 95 percent of all maritime kidnappings last year  130 out of 135 cases, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which monitors security at sea. The Chinese fishing boast, registered in Gabon, was seized by such pirates using high-speed boats off the Gabonese port of Port-Gentil on February 7. The boat with the crew still on board was spotted some 110 kilometres from the Nigerian island of Bonny a few days after the attack. Maritime security consultants Dryad Global said the hijacked Chinese boat was used as a “mothership” for attacks on oil tankers. Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea has its roots in Nigeria’s Niger Delta where oil wealth has failed to reach local populations and deep poverty has stoked militancy and armed unrest. Gangs speed out from swamps to raid passing vessels, snatch crews and spirit them back to Nigeria’s shores.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
