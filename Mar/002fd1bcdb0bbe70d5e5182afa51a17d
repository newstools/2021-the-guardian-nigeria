Aso Rock The Presidency, yesterday, refuted reports that Aso Rock was shattered by an inferno at the weekend. Making the clarification in a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the Federal Government said: “There was no fire inside the Presidential Villa.” “It went on: “People in the country and even abroad have been expressing concerns over reports of a fire incident in Aso Rock Villa, the seat of the Nigerian government. “In the evening of Saturday, March 6, a fire broke out burning shrubs between the outer wire fence and walls surrounding the Villa, precisely in the area between the Villa and the Barracks, towards Asokoro. “The fire, as being speculated, might have started from a passerby dropping a burning cigarette. The Federal Fire Service will ascertain the reason for it when they complete their investigation. “It suffices to say that this bush fire, which started and ended outside the perimeter walls of the Villa, was seamlessly contained by fire stations of the State House and the one nearby from the Federal Fire Service. No loss of life, no loss whatsoever to building and property was recorded. “We thank well-meaning Nigerians for expressed concerns.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
