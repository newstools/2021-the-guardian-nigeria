The network, which is generally favoured by conservatives despite some recent spats between Fox and the former president, made the announcement on-air on the network on Monday. Lara Trump, 38, the wife of the ex-president’s son Eric, was an advisor to the 2020 Trump presidential campaign and has been an unofficial contributor to Fox, which is controlled by the family of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. “I sort of feel like I’ve been an unofficial member of the team for so long,” Trump said as she was introduced on the air during a Fox & Friends segment. “It was kind of a joke over the past five years: I would come there so often that the security guards were like, maybe we should just give you a key.” She has also been considering a run for the US Senate in her home state of North Carolina, according to media reports. “I’m not ready to make an announcement about anything just yet, Carl, but it is something that I am still strongly considering,” Mrs Trump told Saturday Report host Carl Higbie. “I would love to represent the people of my home state in North Carolina, but it is as you know a very big decision. It means a lot of changes for our family.” Lara is the producer and host of Trump Productions’ Real News Update and a former producer of Inside Edition.
