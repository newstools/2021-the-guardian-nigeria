Members of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, yesterday, endorsed the 2023 presidential ambition of Dr. Kayode Fayemi, despite that he has not openly declared his intention for the top seat. The lawmakers pledged their full support to working with well-meaning Nigerians and groups for the realisation of having an Ekiti son as the president. Speaker of the House, Mr. Funminiyi Afuye, who spoke on behalf of the 26-member Assembly, gave the endorsement verdict at the Assembly Complex while receiving a group under the auspices ‘Our Belief Project’. The group’s Co-ordinator, Chief Adewunmi Abejide, said they came to get the Assembly’s nod to pressurise Fayemi to contest the 2023 presidential election Afuye said that the lawmakers were witnesses to the sterling qualities and competence of Fayemi in terms of delivery of democracy dividends, which he said, had led to the radical transformation of the state. “We know that if Governor Fayemi is given a higher responsibility, the members believed that he will surely not disappoint. “The candidature of Dr. Kayode Fayemi in the forthcoming presidential election should make any Ekiti man proud, because he had been administering Ekiti State the way the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo governed the old Western Region, however, with a modern touch. “You don’t need to preach to us, we are with you on this and we promise to give you full support,” the Speaker said. Abejide, who said that it was high time an Ekiti man became the nation’s president, said the group had consulted notable leaders and traditional rulers across Yorubaland and that it was clear that Governor Fayemi is the best man for the job. “I call on the House members, being representatives of their various constituencies, to join well-meaning Nigerians to prevail on the governor to hearken to the voices of the people by contesting the presidency in the year 2023”. Another top notch of the group, Femi Aregbesola, praised the lawmakers for their support and commitment for the transformation of Ekiti as contained in the vision of Governor Fayemi. Aregbesola, therefore, sought the support of the lawmakers towards achieving success in the group’s objective.
