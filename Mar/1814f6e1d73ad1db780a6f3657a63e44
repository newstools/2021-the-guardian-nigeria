Justin Bieber | Justice album cover Just about a year after releasing “Changes”, Justin Bieber releases his sixth studio album “Justice”. The album features guest appearances from Khalid, Chance the Rapper, the Kid Laroi, Dominic Fike, Daniel Caesar, Giveon, Beam, Burna Boy, Benny Blanco and TroyBoi. In line with the title, the album features a Martin Luther King Jr. interlude on which the late civil rights leader delivers a sermon titled “But If Not”. Speaking about the inspiration behind the album, Bieber said in a statement:“In a time when there’s so much wrong with this broken planet, we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone. Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren’t alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another.” Justin Bieber | Image: RORY Bieber added: “I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united. This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to heal.” Stream “Justice” below:   Bieber also released the music video for “Peaches,” featuring Daniel Caesar and GIVEŌN.
