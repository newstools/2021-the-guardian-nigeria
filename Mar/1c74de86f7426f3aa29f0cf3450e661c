To reduce the degree of corruption in public life in Nigeria, the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Ahmed Idris, has called for a quarterly audit of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). The AGF, who made the advocacy yesterday during a meeting with the newly-appointed Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF), Mr. Adolphus Aghughu, explained that doing audits would create cooperation, understanding and harmonious working relationship between federal auditors and MDAs. The AGF said to reduce the pile-ups of financial reports for auditing, the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation should carry out a quarterly audit of the MDAs. He added that there is a need for renewed orientation on auditing practice. According to AGF, it is time we adopt modern auditing techniques with ICT tools, which make auditing quicker and more accurate. “Auditors are not on a witch-hunt mission; they are to advise and give a positive opinion. “This will reduce embarrassment that accounting officers of MDAs receive in public accounts meetings,” he said. Aghughu appreciated the AGF for his support and encouragement. He solicited stronger collaboration between the Treasury Audit Department of his office and the Consolidated Accounts Department of OAGF to timely resolve issues that may cause  delay in the completion of work on financial statements.
