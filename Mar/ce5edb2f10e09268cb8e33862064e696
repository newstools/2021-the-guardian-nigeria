A Chinese construction firm, Eighteenth Engineering Company, has said that the first flyover in North-East would be ready for use later in the year.
  
The N4.2 billion overhead bridge construction contract was awarded to the Chinese company in 2019 by the Borno State Government. Governor Babagana Zulum, last year flagged off the construction of the overhead bridge in Maiduguri, the state capital, to make it the third flyover in the entire north.
  
Managing Director of the company, Mr. Qim Weiguo, told journalists in Abuja that “construction work at the site has attained 63 per cent completion and will be ready for use by September”.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
