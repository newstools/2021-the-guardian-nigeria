Reactions As Prince William Is Named World’s Sexiest Bald Man A new survey has decidedly crowned Prince William as the world’s sexiest bald man, however, the internet has its doubts about the accuracy of this study. Boxing legend Mike Tyson, 54, came second with 8.8million “sexy”, “hot” or “attractive” mentions on the internet. While 53-year-old Fast & Furious star Jason Statham was in third place, with 7.4million results. Russian President Vladimir Putin just missed out on a spot in the top ten, with 2.2m results. Star Trek icon Patrick Stewart got 1.1m ‘sexy’ mentions online. Baldy Steve Jones, 43, of Hastings, East Sussex, said: “I’ve been bald since I was in my early 30s and I must admit as soon as I lost my hair I suddenly became irresistible to the opposite sex. The study was carried out by cosmetic surgery specialists Longevita. A spokesman said: “There are quite a few bald public figures we can feast our eyes on.” After the list was made public, many shared their thoughts on social media. Stanley Tucci fans, in particular, have been very vocal on the new poll, voicing their uproar about the ‘erasure’ of the actor. A now-viral tweet from writer Bolu Babalola, author of Love in Colour, was among those pointing out that Tucci is a worthier winner, vowing ‘Stanley Tucci I will avenge you.’ “What did Stanley Tucci do to deserve this disrespect,” wrote one fan. Tucci, who has starred in multiple films and TV shows delighted fans at the start of the pandemic by sharing a cocktail-making tutorial on social media. Tucci himself responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on Instagram captioned ‘Whose crown should wear this crown? So many wonderful choices.’   A post shared by Stanley Tucci (@stanleytucci)  Other social media users found the ranking to be comical and poked fun at the list in other ways. “April fools day is next week, please. Delete this. It’s not too late,” one user wrote while another said: “This must be a slap for bald men everywhere.”
