Burna Boy | Image: RICH FURY/GETTY IMAGES Burna Boy closed out the 2021 Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony with a medley performance just after winning his first-ever Grammy Awards for his 2020 album “Twice as Tall”. The Nigerian artiste won his first Grammy in the Best Global Music Album category for his 2020 LP “Twice As Tall”. Burna Boy performed a mash-up of “Level Up” and “Onyeka” from his 2020 album “Twice As Tall”, and “Ye” from his 2018 album “Outside”. His performance began outside the National Arts Theatre in Lagos. He was joined by a choir dressed in white, before moving into a space decorated with stained glass where he was backed by musicians and dancers in traditional African dress. The performance finished in a room filled with dry ice and mirrored screens, with the gospel choir returning and more musicians dressed in white joining the action.
