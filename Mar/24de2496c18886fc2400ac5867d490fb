The serious business of motherhood and women’s rights,  entertainment in the form of movies, music and celebs, reflected the mood of Nigerians in March, according to Google Search behaviour. On March 8,  a day to mark the International Women’s Day (IWD), Nigerians joined the world to commemorate the cultural, political, social and economic achievements of women. The theme, “Choose to Challenge”, urged women to take charge of their thoughts and actions, and to call out gender bias and inequality. It also marked a time to seek out and celebrate women’s achievements in Nigeria. Interest in motherhood also peaked online during the month as Nigeria celebrated Mothers’ Day on March 14. In Nigeria, this special day, also known as Mothering Sunday, is when Nigerians traditionally honour mothers in appreciation for all they do. Everyone from celebrities and corporates, to religious organisations, joined in  the celebration. The movie, Coming 2 America, the sequel of the American 1988 comedy film Coming to America starring Eddie Murphy, also had Nigerians hitting the search key in March. While the movie features top names like Arsenio Hall and Wesley Snipes, Nigerians were more interested in the role played by multi-award winning singer Davido, who made his international debut appearance with a cameo in the Hollywood comedy.
