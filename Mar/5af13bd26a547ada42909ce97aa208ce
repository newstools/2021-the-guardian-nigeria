Accounts hit 1.2 billion globally Mobile Money transactions rose by 65 per cent in 2020 with accounts across the globe hitting 1.2 billion. The Global System for Mobile telecommunications Association (GSMA) disclosed this yesterday while unveiling its yearly ‘State of the Industry Report on Mobile Money’. It noted that there was a dramatic acceleration in mobile transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic as lockdown restrictions limited access to cash and financial institutions.
   
GSMA said it found out that the number of registered accounts grew by 13 per cent globally in 2020 to more than 1.2 billion – double the forecast. It stressed that the fastest growth was in markets where governments provided significant pandemic relief to their citizens.
