Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested Emmanuel Chigozie Eze for allegedly stealing over 20 million naira from his employers. The 35-year-old who is the Head of Sales for Procter and Gamble company, during interrogation, claimed to have spent the money on online sports betting. He was arrested along ‘K-Line area’ of Ewet Housing Estate in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state, following a petition. The petitioner alleged that Eze used his position as Head of Sales for Procter and Gamble, to supply goods worth over N20m to customers and converted the same for personal use. According to the complainant, the suspect between March 2020 and January 2021, sold goods worth the said amount and fraudulently collected monies from various customers using his personal account rather than the company’s account. According to EFCC investigations, the suspect has a severe gambling problem as he spent over N4m placing bets on a daily basis with almost nothing to show for it. It was also discovered that between July and December 2020, the suspect received over N18m from one of the company’s major customers (name withheld) for goods, which were not fully delivered. According to the customer, she’s still expecting the balance of goods worth over N8m. Wilson Uwujaren the EFCC Spokesperson, said the suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded.
