The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Bauchi State Council has expressed sadness over threat to life of its member and publisher of an online newspaper, Wikki Times, Mr. Haruna Mohammed Salisu. According to NUJ, a threat letter was smuggled through the journalist’s door, stating that his movement and that of his family members were known, and Haruna would get to hear from them. The letter was suspected to have emanated from an eye clinic that the journalist exposed alleged sharp practices in a two-month investigation. The clinic had instituted a suit at the Bauchi State High Court, seeking N1b in the libel suit. NUJ said this came, when the clinic sued the proprietor over alleged defamatory reports carried by Wikki Times and hearing on the case was ongoing. The union expressed confidence in the judiciary, but condemned the threat to Mohammed’s life. A press statement by the Council’s Secretary, Isa Garba Gadau, said journalists, as contained in the nation’s Constitution, should hold government and individuals accountable to the people and therefore, saw no reason why they should be deterred from carrying out this constitutional mandate. The union urged security operatives to commence investigation into the matter. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
