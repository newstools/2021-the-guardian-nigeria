Leonie Elverfeldt, Managing Director of Pulse Kenya and Managing Director for the East African region says: “With our Pulse brand and the successes we celebrate in our other markets, we are sure to hit the right spot in Uganda as well. Content is King and Distribution is Queen. The Ugandan audience and brands are ready for an engaging millennial content brand. Enabling young people in the country to inform & engage their compatriots via an innovative media platform is close to our heart and we cannot wait to start.” Speaking on the expansion in Francophone West Africa, Caroline Mbodj, Managing Director of Pulse Senegal and Managing Director for the region at Pulse adds: “I am more than excited to work on the pan-African idea of Pulse: our growth to Côte d'Ivoire will be the opportunity to inject a new dynamic in the way content and media are evolving in Francophone Africa and beyond.” The crucial positions for Managing Director Pulse Uganda (https://bit.ly/3qCGUQX) and Managing Director Pulse Côte d'Ivoire (FR) (https://bit.ly/2PNu31n) are currently open for applications via the shown links.
