Ofuma Women Organisation (OWO) has condemned the tagging of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as ‘Hausa-Fulani Party’ in the South East, describing the tag as negative ethnic profiling. Disclosing this to newsmen during the sensitisation of the Contact and Mobilisation support team of the group in Awka, Anambra State, yesterday, the founder and President of OWO, Mrs. Uzoamaka Okpalaezeukwu, pointed out that all parties in Nigeria were the same. According to her, all the parties have membership spread across the different ethnic divides, adding that the negative tag of APC as a tribal party is the handiwork of the opposition. “OWO has over 50,000 members spread across all the states of the federation,” she said, stressing that APC was being transformed as good and trusted people join it. The major task facing the group, she revealed, is to mobilise its supporters and other eligible voters to participate in the ongoing APC membership and verification exercise, to make them eligible to participate in the internal and external democratic processes. She said APC had done more for the people of the South East and South South geo-political zones, despite that the two zones voted en masse for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2025 and 2019 elections. Under the APC government, the South East and South South zones enjoyed democracy dividends, she said, harping on the need for the people of the South East to forge a united front to speak with one voice on the issue of a Presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general election. She also noted the group’s support for power to shift from Anambra North to Anambra South, saying “it is in the best interest of equity, justice and fairness.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
