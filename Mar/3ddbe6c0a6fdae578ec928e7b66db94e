Abia State Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality, Extra-Judicial Killings, and other related matters has summoned one Mrs Ejike to appear before it on March 24, 2021, to give evidence as to the whereabouts of one Mr Ezenwoke Omelihu since June 17, 2020. The Police allegedly arrested the said Mr Omelihu on that date along with Mrs Ejike from the same compound about 11 pm, but Omelihu has not been seen or his whereabouts known to date. The Panel presided over by a retired Chief Judge of the State, Mr. Justice Sunday Imo issued the summons when Mr Omelihu’s uncle, Prince Nwaoguegbe Nwankwo testified before the Panel and narrated the various efforts their family had made to locate him. Prince Nwankwo deposed that when he visited the Azuka Police Station Ogbor Hill, Aba two weeks ago, Omelihu’s tricycle was still at the Azuka Police Station. He consequently pleaded with the panel to help him locate Omelihu or find out what has befallen him. But the Police Counsel DSP F. C. Okafor while cross-examining Nwankwo described his testimony as “cock and bull story” and an untruthful witness whose rendition was far from the scene of the incident. Further proceedings will continue on March 24, 2021. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
