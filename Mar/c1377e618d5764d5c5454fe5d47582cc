These were Biden’s strongest remarks yet in the Cuomo scandal, although he once again stopped short of joining others — including Democrats — in calling for the governor’s immediate resignation. Eight women have come forward since last month to denounce what they said were inappropriate words and gestures from Cuomo. One former employee said he slipped his hand under her blouse last year. Cuomo denies sexual harassment and is refusing the calls to resign. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
