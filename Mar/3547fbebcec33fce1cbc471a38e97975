In a circular addressed to banks, the international money transfer operators (IMTOs) and the public, the regulator unveiled a new scheme tagged ‘CBN Naira 4 Dollar Scheme,’ akin to the traditional end of year sales promo.  “In effect, a typical recipient of diaspora remittances will, at the point of collection, receive not only the USD sent from abroad but also the additional N5 per USD received,” the Bank said in the memo signed by the Director, Trade and Exchange Department, A.S Jibrin. The promo, which targets the supply side of the market, becomes effective from Monday, March 8, 2020. The CBN said in the circular that banks and IMTOs have been briefed on the implementation. 
   
As attractive as the incentive sounds, economists balk at its ability to turn the tide, as the black market routes remain more attractive. 
   
The United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to reduce the cost of remittances, which Bretton Woods institutions, particularly the World Bank, admits are crucial for addressing global poverty and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19, to three per cent by 2030. 
   
Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, is the most expensive region to send money to globally. In the third quarter of 2020, the average cost of sending $200 to Sub-Saharan Africa was put at about 8.5 per cent by the World Bank, well above the global average of 6.8 per cent.
