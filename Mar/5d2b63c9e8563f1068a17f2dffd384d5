• Promises state’s participation in a national livestock transformation programme
• Decries attack on Benue gov, Ortom No fewer than 100 cows have been arrested by men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, code-named Amotekun Corps, for breaching the anti-grazing orders of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu aimed at curbing farmers/herders clashes in the state. The Guardian gathered that the cows were arrested alongside nine herdsmen along Akure/Ilesa Road on Sunday evening after causing hiccups on the highway. The state’s Commander of Amotekun, Mr. Adetunji Adeleye, told The Guardian, yesterday, the cows were intercepted and arrested at the boundary of Osun and Ondo states. Adeyeye disclosed that the cows were actually blocking the major road leading to the state capital, stressing: “Apart from the possibility of illegal grazing in most cases, it is the ploy that kidnappers use.” Meanwhile, the governor has reiterated that the state government was not ready to compromise the protection of the Ondo people and their lands amid farmer/herders clashes. He also vowed to proscribe illegal occupants of the state forest reserves, stressing his readiness to participate in the National Livestock Transformation Programme. He said this, yesterday, during the swearing-in ceremony of the new Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Oladunni Odu, and four other special advisers at the governor’s office, Akure. He said: “May we use this occasion to reiterate our position on the eviction of all trespassers occupying our forests. “We will continue to eject and punish, in accordance with the law, anyone, either herder or farmer illegally occupying our forest reserves. We will not relent on our decision to rid our state of undesirable elements. “We reiterate our stance on the prohibition of open grazing by cattle rearers in any part of Ondo State. There shall be no compromise. We will continue to arrest any under-aged herders in the state. “The government will prosecute the mindless handlers of these unfortunate kids. We will insist on punishing any errant herdsman and exact compensation commensurate to the level of destruction of farms and businesses in any part of the state. IN the meantime, Akeredolu has decried the recent attack on the convoy of Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, urging security agencies to fish out the perpetrators and bring them to book. The governor justified the choice of the first female SSG, saying: “The Curriculum Vitae attests, eloquently, to the appropriateness of this choice. Oladunni Odu symbolises the limitless possibilities of attainment for a well-trained female child. “She represents the erstwhile suppressed voices on account of gender. She has been around for quite sometime. She has seen it all but this is a new experience. She is expected to bring to bear her wealth of experience as a seasoned administrator, lawyer and, I dare say, an academic.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
