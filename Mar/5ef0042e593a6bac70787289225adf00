While receiving the award yesterday in Abuja, Buhari congratulated the outgoing Nigerien President for completing his second tenure, and winning the 2020 Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. Buhari felicitated with Issoufou for upholding the tenets of democracy, improving the economy of his country and consolidating the good relations that existed between Nigeria and Niger. The Nigerian leader said his first visit after swearing-in in 2015 was to Niger Republic, noting that the choice of a neighbouring country underscored the value and quality of relations between both countries. His words: “Nigeria-Niger relations are based on a long common border and shared cultural and historical roots. Relations between the two countries have, over the years, been very cordial. There is a spirit of good neighbourliness between us.” Issoufou thanked Buhari and Nigerians for the support he received as leader of his country for 10 years, particularly during his time as Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), describing Nigeria as a “second home”. The Nigerien President said the highest national award of his country was bestowed on Buhari because of his “fraternity, vigour, patriotism and determination to move Africa forward, starting from the West Coast.” Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said that Issoufou distinguished himself in leadership at both national and regional levels, avoiding the trap of altering the constitution to prolong his stay in office.
