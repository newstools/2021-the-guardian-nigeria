The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said that linking it with attacks on security operatives in the South East and South South regions is another ploy by military to kill more innocent and unarmed residents. IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, stated yesterday that neither its members nor the personnel of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) were responsible for recent attacks on security agents and their facilities in the regions, stressing that it had only attempted to resist terrorists in the forests. It dismissed allegations by the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, that ESN personnel were responsible for recent attacks on state security operatives in South East and South South. “We are, however, not surprised that the Nigerian government will easily point fingers at us. We know their antics. They are only looking for justification to launch fresh military operation in the South East and South South, to kill more innocent and unarmed Biafrans,” IPOB stated. The group alleged that the navy spared Fulani bandits that daily slaughter both security operatives and civilians in parts of the country, but was threatening military operation against ESN and IPOB. “What offence has ESN committed other than flushing terrorists out of our land? When has resisting terrorists in the forest translate to attacking security operatives? We have stated that ESN is not after security agents, but terrorists rampaging our communities. ESN operates in the bushes and not in the cities. Anyone looking for them should go to the forests. “Neither ESN nor IPOB is involved in the purported attacks against security agents. This is another fabricated lie by the Nigerian military to blackmail the security outfit and have another excuse to attack innocent people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
