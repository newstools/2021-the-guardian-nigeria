It is gratifying to note that Nigeria has a huge population with great economic opportunities despite current challenges facing the nation, the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, has said. Mohammed disclosed this, yesterday, in a meeting at the headquarters of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment in Abuja.
   
Mohammed noted: “This is a country that is diverse in nature, ethnicity, religious backgrounds and opportunities, but these are its strengths, not weaknesses and I think the narrative for Nigeria has to change to one that is very much the reality.”
