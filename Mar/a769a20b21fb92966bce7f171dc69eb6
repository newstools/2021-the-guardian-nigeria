 [FILES] Osun  Sources said 15 persons suspected to have been directly involved in the disturbance to public peace had been arrested by the police. The bodies of the deceased, which were said to have littered the streets, had been evacuated and deposited at the mortuary. The Guardian gathered that a buildup to the violence was first noticed at Obalende area on Saturday night when a simple disagreement between the groups almost led to a fracas. The mayhem, according to sources, started at around 9.30 am when members of the gangs stormed the areas brandishing dangerous weapons and causing pandemonium in the neighbourhood. A source said the arrival of the gangs created confusion, while residents in the areas and worshippers going for early morning church service fled in different directions and others hurriedly shut their doors to avoid being caught in the crisis. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state command, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the development, saying 10 suspects arrested in connection with the mayhem would undergo thorough investigation and prosecution. Gang violence has become the order of the day in various locations in the state. Two weeks ago, a similar incident occurred at Woleola area, Osogbo, where no fewer than 10 persons were wounded.
