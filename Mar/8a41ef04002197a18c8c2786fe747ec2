Minister of Defence, Major General Salihi Magashi (rtd), yesterday, admitted that Nigeria was in a critical situation following resurging terrorists’ attacks, banditry and abductions across the federation. He said the security challenges required the support and collaboration of the civilian populace and critical stakeholders. Addressing a National Defence and Security Summit organised by the Defence Headquarters with the theme ‘Promoting Kinetic Operations as a Major Plank for Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Insurgency in Nigeria’, the minister observed: “We are in a critical situation that requires the understanding, buy-in, support and collaboration of important stakeholders and key players in this strategic option and national task. This is important to minimise distractions and maximise civil support in order to facilitate operational success and mission outcomes.” He added: “This summit is coming at a sober time in the life of our dear nation. A time when merchants of violence are threatening to tear the very foundation of our nation, a time when diverse manifestations of security threats dot the landscape and impact individuals, communities, and almost all sub-national entities in disconcerting ways, a time when fear and uncertainty pervade the land; and a time when global indicators of national insecurity give room for serious concern. “Physical insecurity in Nigeria, expectedly, has both forward and backward linkages to different shades and forms of national security. Indeed, it is linked to political instability, economic under-development, and social inequalities. Others are food insecurity and cumulative environmental degradation. These indicate the multi-dimensional nature of national insecurity.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
