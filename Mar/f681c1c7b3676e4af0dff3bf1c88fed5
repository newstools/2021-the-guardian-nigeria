Similarly, all other indices finished lower except NSE Mainboard, NSE Insurance, NSE ASeM, NSE MERI Growth, NSE Consumer Goods and NSE Oil/Gas Indices, which rose by 0.37 per cent, 2.84 per cent, 0.12 per cent, 0.24 per cent, 2.18 and 0.59 per cent while the NSE Sovereign Bond Index closed flat. Analysts attributed last week’s sell-off to profit-taking in stocks that had rallied significantly before the beginning of the earnings season. They argued that sentiment is expected to remain bearish in the near term with investors leaning towards the fixed income space. However, they urged investors to increase their stake in blue-chips, noting that downturn presents attractive entry opportunities in the equities market. The Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said dividend-paying stocks, which suffered year-to-date and 52-week slide of 20 per cent and above during these selloffs are becoming attractive to consider for different investment objectives. “Invesdata still believes that the recent rise in treasury bills and bonds yields is not enough to scare investors away from the equity market at this time when economic recovery is ongoing, even as oil price sells farther above the nation’s budget benchmark price. “This is expected to support government spending and project execution, by reducing the projected deficit for the year that would be financed through the capital market, as well as ways and means through the central bank. “We expect the mixed trend to continue as more corporate earnings hit the market in the face of rising fixed income market yields, oil prices and high dividend yields during this earnings season. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “We expect the choppy theme that played out this week to persist in the week ahead as investors continue to cherry-pick dividend-paying stocks and, at the same time, exhibit reluctance in leaving gains in the market. “With uncertainties about the direction of yields in the FI market still bugging investors’ minds, the bears are likely to retain dominance in the market.
