 [FILES] Rohr  Nigeria will play its final two African Cup of Nations qualifiers against the Benin Republic and Lesotho on March 27 and 30 respectively, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed. According to the new dates, the Super Eagles will meet the Squirrels of Benin Republic at the Charles de Gaulle Stadium, Porto Novo by 5.00 p.m. on March 27, and then come back to host Lesotho at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos on March 30. The game will also kick-off by 5.00 p.m. Super Eagles Media Officer, Babafemi Raji, told The Guardian yesterday that the coaches have started preparing to receive players for the game, adding that the team will camp in Lagos ahead of both matches. “The FIFA free window this time is too short, from March 22 to 30; so, we want to make the best use of the time. “The players will start arriving in Lagos from March 22 after featuring for their clubs at the weekend with preparations starting immediately.” Earlier, Nigeria Football Federation’s (NFF) Media Director, Ademola Olajire, disclosed that Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, would release the list of players for the qualifiers this week. Olajire dismissed the reports in some media outlets that the Super Eagles will travel to Benin Republic by boat to avoid the bad road from Lagos to Seme Border, saying the federation has not decided how the team will travel for the game. “I don’t have details… I cannot give you incorrect information. Nothing is sealed yet,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
