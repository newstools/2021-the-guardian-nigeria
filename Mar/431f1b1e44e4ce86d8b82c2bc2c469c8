Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was detained in Iran in 2016, is due to be released on March 7, 2021, the official end of a sentence over charges she plotted to overthrow the regime in Tehran. Nazanin, now 42, has strenuously denied the accusations with her case becoming a matter of major diplomatic disagreement between Britain and Iran during the five years she has spent separated from her husband and young daughter.

We continue to do all we can to support her,” he added.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
