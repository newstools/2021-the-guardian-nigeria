 Okonjo-Iweala  In a statement issued by her Media Adviser, Paul Nwabiuku, she described the reports as disturbing and appealed for an end to fresh messages consoling her and her family. “Our attention has been drawn to reports that Prof. Chukuka Okonjo, former Obi of Ogwashi-Uku, who passed away in 2019, died again on March 15, 2021. As a result, the Okonjo and Iweala families have been inundated with condolence messages and inquiries. “It is difficult to determine the agenda behind the strange and unprofessional story published on the eve of the 91st birthday of the late Prof. Kamene Okonjo, who was the wife of the late Obi. “But the erroneous reports and the reactions they have elicited from family, friends, and associates are causing the family much distress and we urge media platforms still carrying the reports to desist in the interest of decency and professional ethics,” the statement reads.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
