The experience of a customer is hardly ever an exciting one all through. Some customers have very memorable experiences with products or services while several others would rather put their memories behind as they are, to say the very least, disappointing.
  
This happens because even the best products sometimes manifest factory defects after purchase while in the case of services there could be service delivery failure.
  
The challenge of poor customer satisfaction cuts across all the sectors of the economy. From aviation to manufacturing, hospitality business, education, transport, eCommerce and even telecoms, there have been stories of poor services. For instance, this is why in Aviation, a flight scheduled for 9 am on a particular day may not hit the sky until late in the evening, and sometimes the next day. Most times, for this infraction, no official is punished. 
   
Indeed, despite the level of development in the ICT/telecoms sector, the industry is not immune from the challenge of poor customer satisfaction. Consumerism is also a major issue in the industry. The sector has been confronted with several complaints, which came by from poor services such as drop calls, unsolicited SMS, fake products (phones); incomplete calls, illegal deductions, among others.  Blocking service loopholes 
Several directions have been handed to service providers to ensure consumers are not short-changed by service providers. Some of the directions include Do-Not-Disturb, Data Roll-Over, automatic renewal of data services, and forceful subscription to data services and Value-Added Services.
  
The Commission has approved the restructuring of legacy consumer outreach and engagement programmes. These modifications were made to increase the reach to telecoms consumers wherever they are. 
  
Some of the new information and education programmes include Telecom Town Halls on Radio, a phone-in dialogic programme hosted via radio stations across the country where consumers at the grassroots level are engaged in their local language; Telecom and The Citizen – a biweekly Twitter Live Chat targeting social media users; Telecom TV Dialogue – a monthly television-based discourse on topical telecom issues, among others.
   
In keeping with the global best practice of digital public communication for information and complaints management, the Commission has continued to leverage social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, to inform and educate consumers and to use them as complaints channels for the Commission. 
   
Also, the NCC Consumer Web Portal serves as an alternative online channel for lodging complaints and making inquiries. The specially created toll-free number 622 and DND shortcode 2442 are also active. They are emplaced respectively to enable consumers to escalate unresolved complaints earlier reported to service providers, and to manage unsolicited messages. Just last month, there was a report that  “NCC’s DND crashes unsolicited SMS by 96.6 per cent in three years”.  It must also be stated that the toll-free three-digit 112 Emergency Number has also been created to bring succour and necessary assistance from appropriate Response Agencies (RAs) to address the emergency needs of citizens. Protecting the Consumer going forward 
The process of ensuring customers get value for their money started as far back as 2017 when NCC declared the year as “Year of the Telecom Consumer”, in recognition of the central place the consumer occupies in the telecoms ecosystem and in the emergent digital economy. In the same year, the WCRD focused on “Better Digital World”. The declaration by the Commission and the focus by WCRD 2017 emphasised the need to build a digital world consumers can trust. 
   
In 2021, the theme for WCRD is “Tackling Plastic Pollution”, and the plan focused on raising awareness and engaging state and non-state actors on the global plastic pollution crisis. This is coming three years after the NCC drafted the Nigerian Communications Industry eWaste Regulations in 2018. The objective of the regulation is to manage e-waste; promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery; improve the environmental management system of operators in the telecom industry and reduce greenhouse emissions as well as enhance sustainable development efforts. This is also targeted at ensuring that Nigerians get quality devices that are not harmful to their lives. In reconnecting with the theme for this Year’s celebration, it bears restating, that, while the NCC is concluding processes to issue the regulation on electronic waste, it is mindful of the fact that many ICT and telecom devices have plastic components, whose waste materials could worsen plastic pollution. 
   
In other words, NCC reckoned that improper disposal of such disused ICT-plastic embedded products has grave implications on public health, and especially in achieving Goals 11, 12 and 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. 
   
The commission has reiterated that all its activities are designed to give assurance to the consumers that their interests are of paramount importance in the sector to the Commission. 
  
“This is because without the telecoms consumers, there will be no operators and there would be no regulator. Therefore, we seize this opportunity to assure millions of telecom consumers across the country that the Commission will not rest on its oars until the challenges of telecoms consumers have been reduced to the barest minimum,” Danbatta stated.
