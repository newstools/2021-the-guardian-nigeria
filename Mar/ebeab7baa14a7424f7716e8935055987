Former Super Eagles Coach, Christian Chukwu, has advised the team’s current manager, Gernot Rohr, to select players without sentiments for this weekend’s battle against the Squirrels of Benin Republic. Nigeria will travel to Porto Novo for a Cameroun 2022 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic this weekend.  Super Eagles players are expected to start arriving in Lagos today to prepare for the clash billed to hold at the Charles de Gaulle Stadium, Porto Novo. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Chukwu said the current set of Eagles players have what it takes to beat their opponents away from home and qualify for the African Cup of Nations. He noted that with the level of support given to the team by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the Eagles don’t have any excuse not to go the extra mile to defeat Benin Republic on their home soil. “I don’t think there is anything to fear ahead of the AFCON qualifier against Benin Republic. Nigeria has players that can beat Benin and all that is needed is for Rohr to pick with the right set of players for the game. “Because the Eagles will be playing against a West African team, who are tough on the ball, Rohr should pick fit players for the tie,” he said. On the Super Eagles decision to travel by sea to Benin Republic, Chukwu said, “If the NFF has funding issues or is trying to avoid certain COVID-19 protocols, I don’t think travelling by sea is bad provided the players are comfortable with it. “The best international standard to ferry players to an international championship is by air, but if the NFF still insists on taking the Super Eagles to Benin Republic by sea, there is nothing anybody can do about it. They are in charge of Nigerian football.” The Super Eagles camp opened yesterday in Lagos with Rohr leading some players and officials to their Eko Hotels camp.    According to Super Eagles spokesman, Femi Raji, the expected foreign-based players are due to start arriving in camp from this morning to join their counterparts at the Hotel . “By Tuesday morning, I believe a large number of player must have arrived in camp so the team would be having their first work out at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere in the evening. All arrangements for the game is in top gear,” he said. The Super Eagles will play their final group game against Lesotho on March 30 at the Teslim Balogun , Stadium, Lagos.
