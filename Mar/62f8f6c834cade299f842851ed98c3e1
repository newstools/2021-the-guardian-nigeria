The National Leader of the Pan Yoruba Socio- Political Group, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti has relinquished power due to old age. Fasoranti, who is 95 years old, disclosed this during the group’s monthly meeting held in Akure, the Ondo state capital, saying it is appropriate for him to yield ground for a more youthful and energetic person after 13 years in the saddle. According to him, the development became necessary because the group needs an improved organisation with more effective approach to combat the challenges facing Yoruba people. He named the former deputy leader, Ayo Adebanjo, as the acting national leader, while the former financial secretary, Oba Oladipo Olaitan, the Alaago of Kajola Ago, was named Afenifere’s new deputy leader. Fasoranti stepped in as the group leader in 2008 and had fought vigorously for the political and economic development of the Yoruba nation.
