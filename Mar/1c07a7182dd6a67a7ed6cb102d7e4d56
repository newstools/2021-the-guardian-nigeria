United States’ National Basketball Association (NBA) and Hennessy, the world’s best-selling cognac, at the weekend announced a global expansion of their partnership, making Hennessy the “Official Spirit of the NBA” worldwide. The multi-year agreement, which marks the NBA’s first-ever global partnership with a spirits brand drink, ushers in the next chapter of Hennessy’s relationship with the NBA, which expands to the development of basketball globally, including Nigeria. According to NBA officials, Nigeria, which has benefited in the NBA Power Forward Huddle programme in Africa that has churned out stars in basketball domestically in recent times, will benefit from the Hennessy North American deal announced in February 2020. They added that the partnership would go a long way to reshape NBA basketball projects in Nigeria and some other countries in Africa.  “The NBA is more than basketball, and Hennessy is more than cognac. We represent global communities, and this partnership empowers us to support a game and culture that brings people together through entertainment and camaraderie despite the current challenges faced by fans around the world. We share the NBA’s core values of integrity, teamwork, respect and innovation, which are more powerful than ever as we work to inspire and unite people across the globe.” According to NBA Senior Vice President, Media and Business Development, Dan Rossomondo, the partnership expansion marks an exciting milestone for the NBA league and cordial relationship with other countries of the world, as Hennessy becomes the NBA’s first-ever global spirits partner. “We look forward to continuing to celebrate the game of basketball alongside this iconic brand and our fans around the world,” Rossomondo said. NBA said the expanded partnership would tip off in Africa with Nigeria as one of it focal points, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America.
