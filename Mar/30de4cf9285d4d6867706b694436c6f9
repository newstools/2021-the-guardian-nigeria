 Burna boy  As part of its commitment to push the continent’s music frontiers, Apple Music, a subscription-based music streaming service, offering access to over 60 million songs, recently launched its latest campaign, Africa, to the World, a definitive collection of original and exclusive content from some of the continent’s biggest superstars. The campaign features a number of exciting guest playlists, radio and video interviews with music heavyweights such as Burna Boy and fellow Grammy award winner, Wizkid, as well as Davido, Tiwa Savage and South African heavyweights, Nasty C, and AKA, curated by Gelato crooner, Florence Otedola better known as DJ Cuppy on her programme, Africa Now Radio. The campaign also features guest playlists curated by Angelique Kidjo, Sauti Sol, Sho Madjozi, and Master KG. It also explores the creative process behind some of the biggest hits from the stars like Elaine, Adekunle Gold, Sha Sha, Tems, Fireboy DML, Joeboy, and Omah Lay among other continent’s hottest emerging talents. Burna Boy had, after clinching the coveted Best Global Music Album, said, “Africa is here! We are here! You hear me? This is something fantastic for all Africans of my generation, all over the world, and this should be a lesson for all Africans, whatever you are, wherever you are, you can achieve it.” The series also houses Apple Music 1’s One Mixes from some of the continent’s biggest disc jockeys such as DJs Maphorisa, Kabza De Small, Black Coffee, Prince Kaybee, and Black Motion. Apple Music is no stranger to bringing the African heat in its ever-expanding mission to grow its market in the continent. Since expanding into an additional 25 African countries last year, the streaming giant has since released the ‘Africa Month, Oshe Naija, Stream Local, Up Next, and monthly New Artist Spotlight’ campaigns.
