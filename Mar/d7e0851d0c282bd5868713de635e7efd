Japan-based sports entrepreneur and president of Lagos-based nationwide league side Iganmu FC, Dr. Abayomi Egbayelo, has pointed the way forward for the development and growth of Nigerian football. Speaking with journalists at the Agege Stadium during the TCC Football Championship, Egbayelo, praised the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) board led by Amaju Pinnick and LMC boss, Shehu Dikko, for their efforts to reposition football in the country. Egbayelo, who holds a doctorate degree in sports management, however, lamented the dearth of genuinely passionate football investors that would help drive the growth of Nigerian football. “Nigerian football has the potential to be greater than it is now. We have the required talents and the resources. However, many so-called investors have not really put their money where their mouths have been,” Egbayelo remarked. “Nigerian football needs genuinely passionate investors with unflinching desire to put up their resources and finances for the development and growth of Nigerian football.” “The involvement of government in football has been inimical to the development of Nigerian football. Football should not be taken as a mere social tool, but as real business. That’s why we have to attract investors and business oriented individuals and organisations to our football,” he advised.
