She said Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment as the first woman to head WTO had brought smiles to faces in Africa and indeed the entire black race. “Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, is a woman in whom we are well pleased. I dare to say, it’s just the beginning of great things to come. “It also epitomises the vast chest of potential and value women bring to the table if and when given a chance to express ourselves and to excel.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that LAPO has overtime worked for the recognition of women’s contributions to societal development. The LAPO Outstanding Women Leadership Award further demonstrates the organisation’s commitment to women empowerment. It recognises and honours women who have distinguished themselves in their various endeavours: Business, Professional and Public Life.
