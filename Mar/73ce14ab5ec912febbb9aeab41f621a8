 Buhari  In a communiqué issued by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of PANDEF at the end of a virtual meeting last Thursday, the forum commended members of the House of Representatives on their patriotic and unanimous resolution, which directed the Federal Government to handover the recovered loot to Delta State once returned by the United Kingdom (UK). The NEC meeting was the first to be held by the forum after the emergence of its new National Chairman, Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien. The communiqué stated further: “PANDEF restates its commitment to engage with all critical stakeholders of the region, irrespective of political inclination, in its efforts to foster unity, lasting peace, security and sustainable development of the Niger Delta region for the benefit of present and future generations. “It criticises the Federal Executive Council’s approval for the reconstruction of Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road at an outrageous amount of N797 billion while road projects in the Niger Delta region have been fund-starved or abandoned. Meanwhile, oil and gas resources from the Niger Delta remain the nation’s economic mainstay. This sort of inequitable approval does not only further characterise the Federal Government as non-nationalistic but also undermines national concord and peace.
