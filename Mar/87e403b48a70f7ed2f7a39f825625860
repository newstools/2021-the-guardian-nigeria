 Titi Ogunfere  The association, said the training was aimed at supporting entrepreneurs and expos them on how to successfully run design practice. President, IDAN, Omon Mordi, said this while honouring the founder of IDAN, Titi Ogufere, on her new role as the first black female to head the International Federation of Interior Designers and Architect (IFI). Mordi, who spoke at Ogufere’s first anniversary in office, said: “This is the first time that an African and a woman would be the president since the inception of the organisation. This is an inspiration to us, showing that we shouldn not be limited by our environment but seek to create a path for ourselves.” On acceptance of African products in the world, she said: “We can do better but there has been tangible progress in the last few years. I will also thank the fashion industry because that was one of the areas that publicised and exported African designs. Nigeria is now being appreciated not just as a country that exports oil, but also for other talents that we have always had.” She disputed the perception that interior designers were only female, saying: “Historically, the association has been more about women. Men are more in the manufacturing sector and women in the design.” Ogunfere expressed excitement on being the first African woman and youngest president of the association. She said IFI is the world body for interior designers associations, representing 110 countries with its headquarters in New York, adding “Having a black woman decide what the standard for interior design is and regulating the industry is a great privilege and I am honoured to be in that position because I think it is time for Africa to rise.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
