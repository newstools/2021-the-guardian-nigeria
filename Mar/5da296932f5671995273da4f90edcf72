Hawking is one of the most common forms of child labour in Nigeria, yet it’s been forgotten and neglected. In fact, it has already become part of the normal activities of our modern-day societies. It is more rampant among girl-children, and sadly, often results in the involuntary recruitment of many prostitutes and immoral mothers due to their high vulnerability to emotional and physical abuse.
 
According to a report by Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics and UNICEF, more than half of 79 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 are put to work, including in hazardous conditions. And, according to the most recent statement by the International Labour Organization (ILO), at least 43% of Nigerian children are trapped in various forced labour despite international conventions banning it. The statement further unveiled that children as young as 5-10 years are being put to work. This shows that in every 3 Nigerian children, more than 1 is involved in forced labour, hawking inclusive.  There’s the need to equip mothers with several skills and knowledge and how to go about it in establishing viable businesses. There’s the need to innovatively empower mothers with various businesses that could be done at home, especially items that could be produced locally, as for consumptions, it mustn’t be only locally.
 
This would undoubtedly create sustainable and decent means of earning a living for mothers and in return, save the children. It is believed that an empowered and self-reliant mother saves a vulnerable child than anyone else even if it is his father.
