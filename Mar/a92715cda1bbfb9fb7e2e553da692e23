Celebrity salutes these actors that contributed to giving the movie its acting credits. Enyinna Nwigwe  
Dapper and always one to play the leading man, Eyinna Nwigwe played the leading role, Pilot Yakubu Mohammed in Eagle Wings and as usual, the Economics graduate of the University of Calabar brought his ‘A’ game in interpreting the role of the brave and courageous fighter pilot. A native of Ngor-Okpala in Imo State, Enyinna started out as a model before branching out to acting. Those who have followed his career as an actor- from his daring runs as a gay lawyer in Emem Isong’s Reloaded to his deft run as a philandering bachelor in the popular television series Bachelors – describe Enyinna as an actor who is good at what he is doing and who hits the right note anytime he has an opportunity to feature in a movie. Also best known for his performance in the box office hit The Wedding Party 1 & 2, Enyinna has featured in a number of critically acclaimed movies including Black November, Hell or High Water, Living in Bondage: Breaking Free, Red Code, Cold Feet and the yet to be released biopic on former Nigerian ruler Ibrahim Babangida titled Badamasi. Patience Ujah 
A model and actress, the Benue State-born Patience Ene Ujah played the lead female role in Eagles Wings. It is her first major movie outing after her role as Sekyen in the 2019 drama series Halita and Patience proved that she could be relied upon as an actress. Patience graduated from the Benue State University and she was in 2013 crowned as Miss North Central. Looking every inch like a queen, Patience hinted after the premiere of Eagle Wings in Lagos that she looks forward to playing along and raised game in the movie industry. Keppy Ekpeyong 
Veteran actor Keppy Ekpeyong Bassey is in Eagle Wings as Chief of the Air Staff and the dependable actor showed stuff. A native of Akwa-Ibom State who is roundly applauded for his craft and his ability to grab attention with credulity and easy mien, Keppy is without a doubt, one of Nigeria’s best. A veteran and one of the few actors in Nollywood whom ardent fans of the movie would cheer at each time their names appear on the starring list of a movie, Keppy has not looked back since his debut outing in Tade Ogidan’ long rested soap The Boy Next Door, which was produced over 30 years ago. Indeed what was supposed to be a one-off trial, has turned into what can be best described as an enduring romance with the acting vocation for the father and husband, who combines acting with being a talk show host and producer. Currently, a member of the Governing Board of the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB), Keppy who studied Linguistics and holds a second degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos has featured in so many television and movie productions including Ripples, St. Mary, Smoke and Mirror, Inale, Little Angel and Fine Wine. Francis Duru
Notable actor Francis Duru is in Eagles Wings as NAF Chief of Operations.

Star of critically acclaimed flicks such as Rattle Snake, Dust to Dust, and Sgt Okoro, Duru is clearly a versatile actor whose movies have somewhat become a hallmark of nostalgia in the minds of moviegoers. The University of Port Harcourt graduate of theatre arts and former chairman of the Abuja chapter of the Actors Guild of Nigeria is roundly hailed for his professionalism and commitment to the stage and screen acting vocation. An actor whose staying power has been total respect for professional ethics, discipline, and also hard work, Duru has featured in so many movies including Otondo, Stigma, Nnenda, Home in Exile, Worst Enemy, and House in Crisis.
