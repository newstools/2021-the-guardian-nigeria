 Dr Kemi DaSilva-Ibru  “In boardrooms around the world, business leaders are turning into the reality of the business case around inclusive practices making not only business sense but also being the right thing to do. In a gender-equal world, everyone benefits, everyone wins,” she added. 
  
The Chairman, ICCN, Babatunde Savage, represented by Mrs. Olubunmi Osuntuyi, also called for policies that would encourage the appointment of women in key positions and to ensure that such appointments are not lopsided.
  
He advised women to be more outspoken on issues that affect their development, boost their capacity and fight victimisation. He stated that ICCN had been in the pursuit of a 50/50 balance in staffing and employment.
 
The Chairperson, IWD 2021 Committee, Mrs. Maryrose Adebayo said despite the challenges women face, they have a fierce and robust spirit, which propel them to excel in their respective areas. 
  
She said women had faced issues ranging from relegation, deprivation, dehumanization, abuse, and rape but are now in a new dispensation, breaking barriers in every profession.
  
“We choose to challenge gender inequality and rule our world. We choose to ride upon the wings of our challenges and soar like the eagle in the new normal. Our words can change the whole world because we are all together,” Adebayo said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
