Youth alliance hails visit as morale-booster
The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, has led other service chiefs and principal staff officers of the defence and services headquarters on operational visit to Operation Hadarin Daji (OPHD), Zamfara State. The visit was to assess the military operation in the state and appraise the combat and operational readiness of troops. Acting Director Defence Information, Brig-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on arrival at the OPHD Headquarters in Gusau yesterday, stated that the Force Commander, Maj-Gen. Aminu Bande, briefed the service chiefs on the activities of the troops before the CDS addressed the troops. The CDS commended officers and men of OPHD for their efforts and urged them not to relent, but to continue giving their utmost best to ensure the return of lasting peace to the North West zone. He urged them to be more aggressive in routing unrepentant terrorists and other criminals within the North West zone comprising Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi states. Irabor charged the troops to remain focused, committed and resolute in discharging their duties, while assuring that the service chiefs would support and do all needed to enhance their fighting capability and efficiency in their area of operations. He equally assured the troops of improved welfare and prompt resolution of administrative challenges in the operation. The service chiefs, thereafter, visited the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle at the Government House, Gusau. While receiving the CDS, the governor made case for more modern war hardware to be provided for the security agencies operating in the state, to help nip insecurity in the bud. MEANWHILE, the Nigeria Youth Alliance (NYA) has said the visit will boost the morale of troops. NYA President, Mojeed Atanda, and Secretary, Madu Okolie, stated in Abuja yesterday that the visit would also serve as a relief to the people of the North West. “We are glad they have gone to assess the ongoing military operation in the state, as well as appraise the combat and operational readiness of troops in the area of operations. We appeal to Nigerians to continue to support the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) as they strive to make the country peaceful. We especially appeal to youths to eschew violence and support the AFN ably led by Gen. Irabor,” they stated. The group said the successes were a fulfilment of the promise by the CDS that he and the new service chiefs would ensure that Nigerians no longer live in fear.
