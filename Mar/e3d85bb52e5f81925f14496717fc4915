Photo; IAOKOWA Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Aniocha North Council stormed head office of the Delta State Independent Electoral Commission (DSIEC) demanding what they described as ‘stolen mandate’ of its candidate for Issele-Azagba ward 06, Samson Uwandulu. This followed as the DSIEC declared all PDP chairmanship candidates winners of Saturday’s election in the state, as Uwandulu alleged that DSIEC favoured the PDP in spite of scored 408 votes to defeat the PDP candidate who polled 317 votes. He insisted that after counting and collating the votes, he won, adding that before the final results were announced, PDP officials hijacked the ward returning officer and appealed to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to prevail on DSIEC to restore his mandate. An APC leader in the area, Gabriel Uwaje, said the people of Issele-Azagba have been restive since the mandate was hijacked and appealed to the relevant authorities to do the needful and restore normalcy in the locality. On whether he was aware that the APC boycotted the exercise midway, he said the Issele-Azagba people were not aware of such development, insisting that the mandate was given to Uwandulu for effective representation at the council. But Chairman of DSIEC, Mike Ogbodu, ignored the protest and announced that PDP chairmanship candidates won the election in their respective council areas with a landslide. Announcing the results, Ogbodu said the election was conducted with full observance of COVID-19 protocols, adding that the exercise was generally peaceful.
