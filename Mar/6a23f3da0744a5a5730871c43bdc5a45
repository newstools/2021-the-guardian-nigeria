A view taken on March 15, 2021 in the Monumental cemetery of Bergamo, shows the Camp B1 section where around 200 people who died from Covid-19 have been buried, as the majority of the deceased were cremated. – The images of army trucks collecting piled-up coffins from Bergamo swept the world, a shocking testament to the horror of coronavirus. One year on, the wounds are still raw. At the height of the pandemic last year, Father Marco Bergamelli was blessing coffins every ten minutes in this town in the north of Italy.

Istat did not account for the discrepancy between the two figures. The total number of Covid-19-related deaths has now reached more than 100,0000 as Italy — the first European country to face the full force of the pandemic 13 months ago — faces a fresh wave of infections. The Istat figures show Italy’s northern regions, which were hit first and hardest, have suffered the biggest increases in so-called excess deaths. Alongside these grim figures came a record low in the number of births — at 404,104, down 3.8 percent from 2019 — accelerating a trend towards a declining population. The resident population of Italy fell by around 384,000 in 2020 compared to the previous year, “as if a big city like Florence had disappeared”, wrote Istat. As of December 31, 2020, Italy’s population was 59,257,566, down 0.6 percent over 12 months. “The new record low number of births (404,000) and the high number of deaths (746,000), never experienced since the Second World War, accelerate the negative natural dynamic that characterises our country,” Istat said.
