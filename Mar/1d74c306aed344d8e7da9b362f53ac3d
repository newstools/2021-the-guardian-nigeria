Military foils attempt to kidnap students in Kaduna
Group backs gov on non-negotiation with criminals Terrorists have killed one person, abducted six and destroyed properties in Erena Community, Shiroro Local Council of Niger State.
A witness revealed that throughout the operation, which took place on Friday, there was no interception from the community or security operatives. The Guardian learnt that the attack was the first in the community since bandits started attacking the state.
BUT in Kaduna State, troops have foiled attempt by criminals to kidnap students of Government Science Secondary School, Ikara in Ikara Local Council. This was as the military was intensifying effort to secure the release of the 39 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, who are still in captivity. Addressing a press conference, yesterday, in Kaduna, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said: “Between the late hours of Saturday and the early hours of today (Sunday), suspected bandits stormed the Government Science Secondary School, Ikara, to kidnap students. “Fortunately, the students utilised the security warning system in place to alert security forces in the area. The security forces comprising the army, police and some security volunteers moved swiftly to the school and engaged the bandits, forcing them to flee.” According to Aruwan, the military and police are still on the trail of the bandits. He added: “Following a head-count by the school management, the state government can confirm to you that all 307 students have been verified safe. The attempted kidnap was foiled completely and no student was taken from the school. The images provided by the army can attest to this, and will be shared with you.” The commissioner added that bandits also attempted to attack a senior staff quarters around Kaduna Airport in Igabi Local Council. His words: “This attempt was also foiled as the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the army repelled the bandits, with several escaping with gunshot wounds. MEANWHILE, Global Peace and Life Rescue Initiative (GOPRI) has backed Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s position that authorities should not negotiate with terrorists in the country. The non-governmental organisation, however, condemned the kidnap of teachers and students of Federal School of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka. In a statement yesterday in Abuja, the Executive Director, Melvin Ejeh, hailed the governor for his prompt response that resulted in the rescue of 180 students and staff of the school. He expressed optimism that the remaining 39 students would soon be rescued. “We condemn the kidnap of about 39 staff and students of Federal School of Forestry, Afaka in Kaduna State by bandits,” he stated.
