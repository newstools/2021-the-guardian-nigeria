 [FILES] Argo Raak from Estonia won the 2019 edition of the Ondo Auto Rally, which ended in Ilara-Mokin… at the weekend.  At the weekend, Ade Ojuoko, who is the founder of Work and Play, the team behind the yearly car show, said there are plans to raise the event’s offerings. He added: “Our goal is to keep raising the values of the event. We have secured arrangements for the racers to enjoy the pounded yam with vegetables mixed with orisirisi, to explore Ondo State, especially the Idanre Hills, and also to play at the most challenging course in the continent, Elizade Smokin Hills golf course.” The Work and Play team was recently awarded the Best Tourism Promotion Initiative at the 2020 edition of the Nigeria Tourism Award, a development that Ojuoko said has spurred his team to work harder to grow the spirit of Work and Play in the country. The auto fiesta will kick off with a street race on April 3, 2021, in Akure, he said, adding that the race will flag off from the Government House. Other events scheduled for the one-day show are off-road race and drifting,  which will be held at the Ilara-Mokin racing track in Ondo State, he said. In 2020, Work and Play had partnerships with some key motorsports clubs to record successful events and it has also confirmed that this year will also feature some other strategic partnership in an effort to grow the spirit of Work harder and Play harder. “We have an opportunity to make a deeper impact and grow motorsports with collaborations that align with our overall objectives,” Ojuoko added. This year, he said that interest for participation has been received from Lagos, Oyo, Abuja, Kebbi, Nasarawa, and Enugu so far and that will include the logistics of moving their racing cars too from bases to and fro Akure for the racing challenge.
