A pact between the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) and Pharmacist Council of Nigeria (PCN) would have reduced accidents in hospitals if implemented. 
  
The Acting Managing Director of the Fund, Dr. Kelly Nwagha, who disclosed this when he received a delegation of the Association Of Hospital And Administrative Pharmacists Of Nigeria (AHAPN) in Abuja, called for collaboration between the NSITF and hospital pharmacists in the implementation of Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS). 
   
Nwagha lamented the non-implementation of the communiqué reached between the Pharmacist Council of Nigeria and the NSITF, which would have helped more pharmacists in their workplaces and ensured greater productivity.  Providing insights into the NSITF mandate, he explained: “Employment injury scheme is centred basically on one key area; prevention of accidents/injuries in the workplace, which I term preventative service that we provide. 
 
“Good healthy living and stress management which directly improves productivity is a component of what we do under health, safety and environment, which I am heading.
  
“When we carry out preventative measures and there is a failure, we do what we call rehabilitative service, like treating the injured employee to get back to normal working condition. NSITF provides this service.  He explained that his team is a technical group of over 453 members in Abuja, working in about 13 organisations, under the umbrella body of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria.
