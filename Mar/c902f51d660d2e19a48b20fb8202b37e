• OPC leader raise the alarm over killings in Oyo and Oyo State Police Command, yesterday, confirmed the killing of four persons in Ibarapa North Local Government area of Oyo State by unknown gunmen. The President of Igangan Development Advocates (IDA), Wale Oladokun, has told The Guardian four persons were killed in Kokobido village in the council. Oladokun said: “Four persons were killed at Kokobido village in Ibarapa North Local Government Area.” Confirming the incident, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Olugbenga Fadeyi, said: “It was reliably gathered that unknown gunmen attacked and killed four men at Kokobido village, Diko Ile via Ijio at around 3.pm. “The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Ijio quickly moved into the scene and moved the bodies to Fadok Hospital mortuary for autopsy. Efforts are being intensified to arrest the perpetrators of the crime.” Leader of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), Chief Gani Adams, has however raised the alarm over the killing of four men at Idiyan village, Igangan, Oyo State by men alleged to be loyal to detained Abdullah Iskilu Wakili, who is currently under investigation for alleged criminal activities. Adams’ account disclosed that the victims were hacked to death around 2.am. He also disclosed that two among the deceased were members of the community police in Igangan. In a statement yesterday by his media aide, Mr Kehinde Aderemi, Adams expressed displeasure over the gruesome manner in which the victims were murdered. He said the audio and pictorial evidences at his disposal indicated that the killers had been terrorising the village and its environs and also engaging in untold kidnapping, killing. “It was reported that the perpetrators of the crime had earlier collected over N800 million as ransoms from their captives,” he added. According to Adams: “Wakili’s men have displaced more than a million residents in the over 10 villages in Oke-Ogun. They have raped and killed residents at will. The late Alhaja Sherifat, and the late Dr Fatai Aborode and several others were killed and the criminals are still on the rampage. They have been terrorising our people for more than six years. “Wakili was a comedian, pretending to avoid being investigated. He was hale and hearty, but started pretending shortly after he was captured.” Adams, who is the Aare Onakankanfo of Yorubaland, lamented that kidnapping and killings remained unabated. “Today, four men were hacked to death at Idiyan village, and it is sad and most unfortunate that the police are yet to unravel the killers. Security situation in Southwest is becoming too worrisome; it could have been worse if not for the efforts of members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). It is time criminal herders should stay away from Yoruba land because OPC and other local security operatives would continue to ensure that the region is safe for residents.” He said the arrest of four members of OPC, who apprehended Wakili, clearly indicated the failure on the part of the police. Adams, however, urged the police to release the members, and concentrate on getting rid of the Igangan forests bandits and kidnappers. Meanwhile, Mr Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, refused to confirm or comment on the matter when contacted. He said the SSA to the governor on security and the police were in a better position to speak on the development.
