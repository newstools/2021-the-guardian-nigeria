• CP redeploys Ajao estate DPO Lagos State Police Command has arrested no fewer than 113 nightclub attendees for allegedly violating COVID-19 protocols in the State. The violators were arrested on Sunday, March 7, 2021 at Garbana nightclub, Ajao Estate and DNA Club, Victoria Island by police operatives of the command, including the Lagos State Taskforce led by its commander. The Commissioner of Police, while parading the suspects, vowed to go after club owners and their landlords who contravened the town planning approvals of the state by converting their properties meant for other purposes to nightclubs. He vowed to make them scapegoats to serve as a deterrent to others in the state. The police boss also warned against the nonchalant attitude of security personnel towards observing COVID-19 protocols in the state. He also pronounced the redeployment of the DPO Ajao Estate and his senior officers for allowing night clubbing and violation of other COVID-19 protocols in the area, warning others to learn and desist from the negligence of the DPO Ajao Estate as any DPO who promotes violation of COVID-19 protocols will be “fired” and sanctioned.
