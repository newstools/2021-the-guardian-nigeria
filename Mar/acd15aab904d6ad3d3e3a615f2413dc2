Speaking yesterday with journalists after holding separate meetings with the State Administrative Council (SAC) and State Executive Council (SEC) of NLC in Umuahia, Idima said his assumption of office was according to the report of the panel constituted by the NLC. He added that the National Executive Council (NEC) of NLC upheld the report on February 17, 2021. “During the election, the NLC NEC directed any person or group of persons who felt aggrieved with the conduct of the election to file a complaint to NEC. Some states, including Abia, accordingly filed complaints. “It was based on the endorsement of NEC that I have assumed office as the Chairman of NLC, Abia State Council, and today held my maiden meeting,” he said. He vowed not to compromise the workers’ in favour of his personal interests.
