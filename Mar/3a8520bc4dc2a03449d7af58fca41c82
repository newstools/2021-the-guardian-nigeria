Determined to end kidnappings and boost parents’ interest in the education of their children, the Federal Government said that it has begun a ‘back to school’ advocacy in rural communities. The Minister of Women’s Affairs, Pauline Tallen stated this, yesterday, at an interactive session with rural women to mark the International Women’s Month, in Karshi village of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The minister said it was disheartening to see that more girls are no longer going to school because of the spate of kidnappings in the country, assuring that the government is not sparing efforts to bring an end to the menace. She urged parents to join hands with government to fight the battle and secure their children’s future. Tallen advised them to continue sending their children to school to ensure that their future is not thwarted, even as the girl child has become the major target of kidnappers, a ploy against the education of girls in the affected areas. “The inequality rate in the society has greatly impacted on the development and advancement of rural women, thus the need to bridge the gap through intense advocacies and sensitisations. I therefore urge all stakeholders to continue to collaborate with the ministry to ensure that gender equality is achieved in Nigeria through synergy, strategic mobilisation of resources and intense advocacies,” she said. Wife of the Chief of Karshi village, Mrs. Halima Mohammed, assured the government that the council would sustain the advocacies on the importance of girl-child education, as it was fundamental in realising gender equality.
