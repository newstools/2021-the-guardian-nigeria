 Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen. Photo: TWITTER/STERLINGBANK  The information is in a statement signed by the ministry’s Director of Press, Mr Shehu Maikai in Abuja. Maikai stated that Tallen made the call when members of the Association of Women in Energy, Oil and Gas paid her a courtesy visit in Abuja. According to her, men have dominated the oil sector for long, saying there is need for women professionals to make a foray into the very critical area of the economy. She said “in a country where half of the population are women, there is no justification whereby only 15 per cent of the workforce in the oil industry are women.” She highlighted the need for women to reposition their roles in all ramifications, pledging the ministry’s support in any initiative that would improve the interest and status of women for national development. The minister commended the association for championing the campaign for the inclusion of women in the energy, oil and gas sector. She also commended them for their support toward girl-child education, safe drinking water and clean environment in the oil industry host communities. “We must develop programmes that will enable women from host oil producing areas to participate in the industry,’’ she said. The Leader of the association, Dr Oladunmi Owo, said the visit was to solicit for the support of the ministry in the implementation of its programmes for women in oil host communities. Owo added that involving women in oil host communities in the programmes would also improve the nation’s economy, and
stressed the need to bridge the gap between male and female presence in the energy, oil and gas industry. The association, thereafter, appointed the minister as “Global Ambassador for Women in Energy, Oil and Gas’’ for her outstanding contributions to the cause of women and children in the country.
