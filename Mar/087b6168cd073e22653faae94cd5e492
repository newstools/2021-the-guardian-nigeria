Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, said the agency was ready to partner with the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas(NLNG) Limited in increasing natural gas production capacity by 36 per cent. Represented by the Executive Director, Marine and Operations, NPA, at the virtual multilogues-2 organised by the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Usman said the agency would support NLNG in increasing natural gas production from 22 million tonnes to 30 million tonnes yearly. “The NPA is poised to offer necessary collaborative support to the NLNG in achieving the goals of its Train 7 projects, which we are informed will increase Nigeria’s liquified natural gas production capacity by 36 per cent from the current 22 million tonnes per annum to 30 million tonnes per annum,” she said. “This expansion will ensure that Nigeria, with its significant gas reserves considered the ninth largest in the world remains atop, reliable and the preferred supplier of LNG in the ever expanding energy market.” Usman reiterated the need for the deep seaports to accommodate larger vessels and improve port services. “We are also conscious of the current limitation of our seaports in relations to the growing appeal of larger vessels which should be deployed for the purpose of economies of scale. “This is why we are very keen in the construction of deep seaports. Two of those are currently under construction in Lekki and Badagry with prospect of another one in Ibom. These ports will enhance our capacity to export more gas to our growing global client base with better turn around. “Someone may talk about the congestion in Apapa. From tomorrow, we are flagging off our e-callup system that we believe will significantly address congestion at Apapa,” she said. NLNG is a joint venture incorporated in 1989 to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids for export.
