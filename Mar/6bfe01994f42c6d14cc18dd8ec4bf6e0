Worried by the growing rate of vulnerability of orphans in the country, Courteville business enterprise and a team of researchers have launched a TetFund research on the needs and vulnerability of orphans across the country. The 21-day research, which is set to expose the challenges encountered by orphans, is expected to run across six geo-political zones in the country. According to the principal investigator, Professor Olubukola Ojo from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, the recent report of baby factories being closed down, issues of vulnerable children and abuse of children which have been on the increase in the country have led to the project. “Basically, we are interested in knowing placement options of orphans and how orphans find themselves in orphanages or family settings. We also want to investigate their current situation and then look at policies that are in existence to see if there are policy gaps to provide information to the government for intervention,” she said. Speaking on the benefit of the research, the Group Managing Director (GMD) Courteville Business Solutions Plc, Mr Adebola Akindele, said the information would be useful to the economy in terms of informed decisions on how to enhance the present state of orphanages. He added that Lagos State provides the best legal structure on establishing orphanages with the growing number of unregistered homes operating in the country. “Now, we know there are registered homes and unregistered homes. A quick review here shows that there are some unregistered homes that we have supported. Now, we will look at the registered homes and pick maybe the first 10 to assist in any way we can.” “The only way we can assist the society is to assist those that have not conditioned themselves to be in the position they are due to circumstances beyond their control and we all must be able to help them,” he said.
