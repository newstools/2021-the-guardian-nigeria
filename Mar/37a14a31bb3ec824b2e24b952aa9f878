Waidi Akanni, an ex-international, on Monday called on the Super Eagles to go all out against Lesotho, in spite of the team’s qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations. Akanni, a former Chairman of the Lagos State FA, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). “Hopefully they will go all out tomorrow and win convincingly to reassure Nigerians that Super Eagles are a team to beat. “Winning is important but they have to play cohesively, the players need to understand one another,” Akanni said. Akanni,  a member of the team that won bronze medal at 1985 FIFA World Youth Championship, urged Coach Gernot Rohr to give opportunities to other players in order to have a formidable team. “Playing Lesotho, I expect a completely new starting line up; coach Rorh also needs to use a permanent system that Nigerians like, wing play. “Like we all know, there are lots of talents and as such he should select those worthy,” he said. NAN reports that the 33th edition of the  Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled to hold in January 2022; Algeria are defending champions having won in 2019.
