The House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts is set to probe seven government revenue-generating agencies over alleged under-remittance of over N526.35 billion and $21.199 billion to the Federation Account between January 2010 and June 2015. The move by the committee led Mr. Wole Ole, was based on a report from forensic auditors, KPMG, which indicted the agencies. A report indicated that four other agencies under-remitted revenue to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) amounting to about N49.160 billion within the period. The report listed possible under-remittances or over-remittance against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as N557,852, 222,257.28, and $9,048,920,931.38 while the figure listed against the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stood at N39,313,909.42 and $29,261,227.46. It also listed N6,995,100,228.35 against the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), N292,287,246.65 against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), $570,632,772.46 against the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and $4,138,465,740.01 against the Federal Government. However, it explained: “NNPC has an outstanding claim of N797,710,684,354 against the federation prior to January 1, 2010.” Meanwhile, the committee has summoned the Nigerian Customs Service (NSC) over non-rendition of the audited financial accounts to the office of the Audit General of the Federation between 2017 and 2019 financial years. Oke directed the auditor of the NCS to appear before the committee to explain the delay in the audited accounts of the agency for three years. The committee’s position came after grilling Customs official on the audit queries raised against the agency by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation. Blaming the external auditor engaged by the NCS for the delay, the Customs official promised to make the report available as soon as it is ready.
