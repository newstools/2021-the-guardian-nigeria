The survey released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) also showed public frustration with current travel restrictions, but acceptance of a travel app to manage health credentials for travel. According to the report, 88 per cent believe that when opening borders, the right balance must be struck between managing COVID-19 risks and getting the economy going again. About 85 per cent believe that governments should set COVID-19 targets (such as testing capacity or vaccine distribution) to re-open borders. A total of 84 per cent believe that COVID-19 will not disappear, and we need to manage its risks while living and traveling normally. About 68 per cent agreed that their quality of life has suffered from travel restrictions, while 49 per cent believe that air travel restrictions have gone too far. While there is public support for travel restrictions, it is becoming clear that people are feeling more comfortable with managing the risks of COVID-19. People are also feeling frustrated with the loss of freedom to travel, with 68 per cent of respondents indicating their quality of life is suffering as a result. Travel restrictions come with health, social and economic consequences. Nearly 40 per cent of respondents reported mental stress and missing an important human moment as a result of travel restrictions. And over a third have said that restrictions prevent them from doing business normally. IATA’s Director General and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Alexandre de Juniac, said the top priority of everybody at the moment is staying safe amid the COVID-19 crisis. “But it is important that we map a way to be able to re-open borders, manage risks and enable people to get on with their lives. That includes the freedom to travel. It is becoming clear that we will need to learn to live and travel in a world that has COVID-19. “Given the health, social and economic costs of travel restrictions, airlines should be ready to re-connect the world as soon as governments can re-open borders. That’s why a plan with measurable milestones is so critical. Without one, how can we be prepared for restart without an unnecessary delay?” de Juniac said.
