Photo: CURRENTSCHOOLNEWS  While parading the suspects at the command’s headquarters in Lokoja on Monday, the commander, Peter Maigari, said his men made the arrest around 5p.m. on March 4, 2021. According to him, criminals have become sophisticated in their modus operandi, to evade arrest. He added that it took the eagle eyes of the anti-vandal unit of NSCDC to uncover the petroleum products neatly wrapped in polythene bags and covered with bags of sawdust. An escort of the goods reportedly escaped, said the commander, who vowed to ensure that all those behind the act were arrested and prosecuted. Commending President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Ahmed Audi as the Controller-General of NSCDC, which he described as a good omen for the force, Maigari warned criminals to turn a new leaf or be ready to meet their waterloo. The commandant explained that the NSCDC in Kogi was able to use Alternative Conflict Resolution (ACR) to resolve herders-farmers’ clashes in the state. He added that the command achieved a lot under his watch, with many criminal cases under investigation and prosecution, promising to turn the heat against criminals within his jurisdiction until they repent. Driver of the trailer, 25-year-old Mustapha Mohammed, a native of Potiskum in Yobe State, said he was not aware of the content of the consignment, that he was only called to load it from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for delivery to Suleja in Niger State. Also denying knowledge of the owner of the consignment, he said the escort, who ran away on sighting the security personnel, contracted him for the job. Maigari called on the public to avail security agencies of credible information to stem insecurity across the country, promising to make Kogi safe for law-abiding citizens.
