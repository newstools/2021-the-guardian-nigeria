• Protest seven months salary arrears Players and officials of Ondo State-owned football club, Sunshine Stars FC, have decried the non-payment of seven-month arrears by the state government, lamenting unbearable consequences to their career and livelihood. In their scores, the members of the team trooped out to protest in Akure metropolis yesterday, disrupting vehicular movement from their office to the road to the Governors Office gate. The players, who dressed in sporting wears, brandished various placards with inscriptions like “Save Sunshine Stars,” “Mr. Governor help us, pay our salary;” amongst others, singing solidarity songs to drive home their demands. They also alleged that the state government was making moves to sell the team, a move, which they said would not be favourable to them and their career. Security officials were present during the peaceful protest to prevent any break down of law and order. Speaking on behalf of the team, the Captain, Mr. Sunday Abe, said the players found it difficult to cater for their financial needs due to the backlog of salaries owed them by the state government. Abe, who also expressed displeasure over the plans to sell off the team, urged the state government to consider the players in their decisions. Addressing the players, Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, appealed for calm at the Governors Office gate and debunked the alleged plan to sell the team, saying it is a mere rumour. Aiyedatiwa noted that stakeholders would be involved before taking such action and also promised to work on the outstanding wages of the players to be paid as soon as possible.
