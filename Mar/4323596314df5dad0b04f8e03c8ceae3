He also wished the injured victim from Kajinjiri village quick recovery.” IN another development, the authorities of Kebbi State University (KSU), Aliero, has ordered the indefinite closure of the institution, following the murder of a 400-Level Biochemistry student, Shamsudeen Sale, in a mob action. Confirming this to The Guardian in Birnin Kebbi, spokesperson of the university, Hussaini Zuru, said the murder caused the students to go on a rampage, blocking the highway leading to Sokoto State. Zuru said Sale was murdered by some residents of Aliero town when he bought a phone and paid through bank transfer but the sellers could not get a notification immediately. The deceased had gone back to the seller to sort out the issue when the people around started calling him a thief, triggering the mob action that led to his death. When contacted, the image-maker of Kebbi police command, DSP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident but said he was yet to get details.
