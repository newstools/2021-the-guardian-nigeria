“They are fast becoming monsters that cannot be tamed. Their activities can no longer be tolerated in a megacity like Lagos,” the statement read. 
 
According to the group, the people of the state can no longer tolerate a situation whereby youths freely use guns and machetes on the streets, adding that the taxes being collected by the unions on the roads are used to purchase drugs and weapons. 
   
The group advised that the tolls being wrongly collected by NURTW could be used to provide jobs for the teeming and restive youths. “Let us copy from the good examples laid down by Oyo and Ondo states that have disbanded NURTW. Now that politics is around the corner, we cannot afford to arm our youths with uncontrollable weapons and thus build banditry in our dear state. NURTW is a few steps to Boko Haram. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. 
  
“The insecurity in the country has reached an alarming situation that something urgent must be done. The rich and the poor can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed. Let us empower our youths to take a more positive direction and not turn them into miscreants and thugs,” the group advised.
