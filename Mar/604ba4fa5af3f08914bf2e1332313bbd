Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) groups in Isoko North Council Area of Delta State, including stakeholders, youths and women have resisted the choice of Jude Ogbimi as replacement for late Tim Kome Owhefere, who represented Isoko North Constituency in the state House of Assembly. An aide to the late Owhefere’s aides, Udo Gospel, lamented that PDP leaders in the area did not consult widely before presenting Ogbimi to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, as preferred candidate for the vacant seat, noting that the decision was wrong and should be reversed immediately. Udo told The Guardian that Leo Okuweh Ogor, who represents Isoko Constituency in the House of Representatives, presented Ogbimi’s name to Governor Okowa during Owhefere’s burial at Akiowhe. He said PDP leaders, who hosted the governor ganged up to destroy the good works and structures the late Owhefere had put in in the constituency. “This imposition does not show respect for the late Majority Leader. We, therefore, urge Governor Okowa, Hon. Ogor, the state’s party chairman, Kingsley Esiso and other PDP leaders and stakeholders to give us a candidate who knows our pains from the death of Ohwefere and who can sustain his structures. “We urge our leaders to give the ticket to Hon. Richard Isagba from Okweh Ward 1. That is the only way we can all collectively honour the political legacy of the late Owhefere. “Anything short of that is not acceptable. We are hopeful that PDP leaders will heed our call and not unduly heat up Isoko North polity with the imposition of Ogbimi, who is not known to the Ohwefere political family,” he said. He cautioned against Ogbimi’s imposition, describing it as an affront on the sensibility of supporters of the late Ohwefere and that it was bound to spell disaster for the PDP in Isoko North if not reversed.
