 To be or not to be? Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, and Edo State government will today decide whether the National Sports Festival will begin in Benin as scheduled.  He said: “The sports minister, Mr. Sunday Dare, has given a date for the commencement of the festival. We are in touch with him and still waiting for resources to host the game. The moment the resources are available, we are ready.
 
“What actually led to the latest postponement is the unavailability of funds and the minister has assured that funding is not the problem. We have always been ready in Edo and we are ready. We need funds that can take us through. I don’t know what the ministry has approved and nobody has told me what has been approved. What has been approved is still speculation.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
