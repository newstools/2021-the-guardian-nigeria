The Director of External Relations, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Andrew Enahoro, yesterday, said the company’s backward integration programme is an inclusive and sustainable “journey” the firm has taken to support national economic development. 
   
Considering importation logistics challenges and the need to increase local capacity ulitisation, he said backward integration, an option that rationalizes local input sourcing, is the way to go in the country’s quest for industrial revival. 
   
Enahoro said this during an interaction with the journalists where he spoke extensively on the company’s partnership with Ekiti State Government leading to the birth of Ikun Dairy Farm Limited, which recently imported pregnant Jersey cows to support local milk production.
