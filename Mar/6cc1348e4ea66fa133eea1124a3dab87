All other indices finished higher except NSE MERI Value and NSE sovereign bond indices, which declined by 1.54 per cent and 0.13 per cent while the NSE ASeM, NSE AFR dividend yield, and NSE growth indices closed flat. Analysts argued that corporate performance has remained resilient in the face of the lingering macroeconomic headwinds even as quoted companies continue to churn out improved earnings, giving investors insight into how they should position ahead of year-end and the 2021 corporate actions. The Chief Executive Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: “Strength returns to the market on the back of few earnings released so far. “We think that the ongoing season helped by the unchanged interest rates might support the new recovery move by the market. “Investors seeking to preserve their capital and even profit from the ongoing recovery should play fundamentally sound stocks selling at a high margin of safety. This is the time to adopt value and growth investing. “Money flow index revealed the entrance of the funds into equity space as corporate actions and high dividend yields continue to attract demand for blue-chip stocks and high cap equities in hot sectors with strong potential to grow sales in the current financial year.” Codros capital said, “With the MPC meeting now out of the way. We expect investors’ attention to be focused on the bond auction results as they keep an eye on the movement of yields in the FI market.” According to the analyst, as the full year 2020 earnings season gradually fades out, there are anticipations that sentiment would be influenced by developments in the macroeconomic landscape and corporate actions. They urged investors to take positions in only blue-chip stocks, noting that an unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings. A review of market performance last week showed that gains recorded by most blue-chip stocks, especially Julius Berger and Stanbic IBTC Plc, transactions on NSE reopened in an upbeat on Monday, causing market capitalisation to appreciate by N178 billion. At the reopening of trading last week Monday, the ASI rose by 340.48 points or 0.89 per cent to 38,722.87 points. Investors gained N178 billion in value as market capitalisation went up to N20.260 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Stanbic IBTC Holdings, BUA Cement, Julius Berger, Ardova Plc and UAC of Nigeria (UACN). Reacting to market performance, analysts at United Capital Plc said: “We retain the expectation of a short-term rebound in the market. The improving investor sentiment (for the second consecutive week) indicates mild interest in key counters as investors begin to buy the dip but value stocks. Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “With market sentiment seemingly on the up, thanks to some positive earnings and dividend announcements, we expect tomorrow’s (today) session to be neutral to positive. However, we do not rule out the possibility of some profit-taking activities. Investors will also await feedback from the MPC meeting tomorrow (today), which we believe will shape the market direction for the rest of the week.” On the price movement chart, 26 stocks appreciated while eight constituted losers charts.
