Golden Globes: Chloe Zhao Becomes First Asian Woman To Win Best Director “Nomadland” has won the Golden Globe for best picture drama, making history for the Globes, as well as for director Chloé Zhao and for the “Nomadland” producing team. The win is the first time a film directed by a woman has ever won the top prize in the Globes’ 78 ceremonies, and since Zhao produced “Nomadland” as well, she’s also the first Asian woman to win best picture drama as a producer. Star Frances McDormand, who also produced “Nomadland,” is the second woman to be nominated for a Golden Globe both for producing and acting, and the first to win as a producer. Many online praised her for being a “huge inspiration for young Asian girls”, adding that it was a “win for women everywhere”. The Nomadland director, who was born in China, is only the second woman to win the award. The first was Barbra Streisand in 1984. “I cannot stress this enough, as an Asian woman in the arts, it is so inspiring to see Chloe Zhao make history tonight as the first woman of colour to win for best director,” said one Twitter user. This year also marks the first time more than one woman has ever been shortlisted for the title of best director. Regina King and Emerald Fennell were also in the running. Her win was also celebrated on Chinese social media site Weibo, where many praised her talent. The semi-fictional Nomadland, which also took home the award for best drama, stars Frances McDormand as a woman named Fern who travels around America as a modern-day nomad. Chloe Zhao is a Chinese filmmaker who is known primarily for her work in independent U.S. films. Her debut feature film, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, premiered at Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim and earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Her second feature film, The Rider, was critically praised and received nominations for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film and Best Director.
