 History being made as Nigeria takes delivery of about 3.9M doses of the AstraZeneca Vaccine today in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. PHOTO: Twitter  Anxiety and doubts among Nigerians on whether the country could secure the COVID-19 vaccines was put to rest yesterday following the arrival of the first batch of Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine from the COVAX facility.
  
Just as the consignment arrived, the Federal Government disclosed that special centres would be opened for top government functionaries to take the jabs.
 
Nigeria is the third West African country to receive COVID-19 vaccine from COVAX after Ghana and Ivory Coast. Emirates Boeing 777-300ER aircraft carrying 3.94 million doses of the vaccine arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 11.45 a.m. and was received by the Chairman of Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha. They handed over the consignment to the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, who presented to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) for sampling to ensure they were in good condition, safe and effective for Nigerians.
  
The arrival of the vaccine will enable the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to commence vaccination of Nigerians in priority groups, starting with frontline healthcare workers after it has been cleared by NAFDAC.
