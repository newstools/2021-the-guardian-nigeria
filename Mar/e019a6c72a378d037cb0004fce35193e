Trouble reportedly started when some herdsmen allegedly shot a member of Igga community in his farm and blocked sympathisers from taking the victim to the hospital. It was gathered that the refusal to allow the wounded farmer get treated triggered rumpus that attracted members of ESN to the scene, leading to a showdown. A source, however, said that it was amid the attempt to resuscitate the young man with bullet wound that some angry youths on motorcycles stormed the scene and started shooting at those barricading the farmer from receiving medical attention. The ensuing fracas, The Guardian gathered, led to many residents of Adani, an agricultural community, fleeing the area to neighbouring communities in Nsukka and Igboetiti local councils. Some residents of Adani, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed that hunters and even some local vigilante had encountered some unfamiliar faces suspected to be ESN personnel in the forests in the area, who told them that they were not after law-abiding residents. The Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, and other top security operatives in the state visited Adani yesterday for fact-finding at the scene of the incident. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Daniel Ndukwe, who accompanied the CP on the mission, confirmed the incident and promised to make details available in due course.
