The World Health Organization has said countries can continue to use the AstraZeneca vaccine stressing that the benefits outweigh its risks. WHO said it is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety. The organisation said it's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine and once that review is completed, it will immediately communicate the findings to the public. The global health body noted that some countries in the European Union have temporarily suspended use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood coagulation disorders in persons while other countries in the EU, having considered the same information, have decided to continue using the vaccine in their immunization programs. It observed that in extensive vaccination campaigns, it is routine for countries to signal potential adverse events following immunization but this does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to the vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them. It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place. WHO explained that vaccination against COVID-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes stressing that thromboembolic events are known to occur frequently. "Venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease globally."  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
