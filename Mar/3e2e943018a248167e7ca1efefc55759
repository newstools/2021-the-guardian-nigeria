 Apapa Wharf  Some of the truck drivers were seen violating the rules by parking on the major trunk road on Mile 2 axis of Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, but the task force tried to manage the situation and forced them to park on one lane of the busy road. When The Guardian visited, yesterday, the traffic flow was low, while the tanker drivers waiting to load petroleum products occupied one lane of the expressway, leaving the other lane for other commuters. Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had on Wednesday threatened to publish the names of those frustrating the electronic call-up system and “shame them”. Sanwo-Olu said the state government would resist any attempt from any quarters to bring back traffic gridlock. A maritime expert, Emmanuel Maiguwa, said the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) should set up minimum standards for the trucks coming into the ports. Maiguwa, who is the President, Alumni of Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron (AMANO), said: “This is because some of these trucks are worse than junkyard scraps. If they don’t meet minimum standards of operation, one wonders how they get loaded to transport goods. It is for this simple reason of unworthiness that they eventually break down on their way out of port and cause congestion. This gap, if not addressed, would mess up the e-call-up system. A stitch in time saves nine!” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
