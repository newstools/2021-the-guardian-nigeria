The National Judicial Council (NJC) has recommended 18 candidates to President Muhammadu Buhari for appointment as Justices of the Court of Appeal. NJC’s Director of Information, Mr. Soji Oye, in a statement yesterday, said the Council issued a strict warning to two Judges, adding that the Council, which considered the list of candidates presented by its Interview Committee, also recommended the appointment of eight heads of courts in Rivers, Nasarawa, Kogi, Jigawa, Ebonyi and Delta states. He said the decisions were taken at Council’s 94th meeting held on December 17 to 18. The 18 candidates recommended as Justices for Court of Appeal included Justices Bature Isah Gafai; Muhammad Ibrahim Sirajo; Waziri Abdul-Azeez; Yusuf Alhaji Bashir; Usman A. Musale; Jauro Ibrahim Wakili; Abba Bello Mohammed; Grand Kadi Mohammed Danjuma and Danlami Zama Senchi.

According to him, all recommended candidates were expected to be sworn-in after approval by the President and their respective state governors and confirmation by the National Assembly and the respective States Houses of Assembly. “Council decided to issue strong warning letters to Justices Mufutau Olokoba and M. A. Savage of the Lagos State High Court. Olokoba was reprimanded and also put on the watch-list of the Council for his failure to deliver judgment within the constitutional period of 90 days and Savage was reprimanded for not being in charge of his court,” Oye added. He noted that the remaining petitions were summarily dismissed for obvious and manifest lack of merit, being subjudice, overtaken by events, or being matters for appeal.
