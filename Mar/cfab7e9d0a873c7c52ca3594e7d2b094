Gains were capped however by fears over a surge in inflation that the recovery is expected to bring with it. Oil prices fell more than one percent as traffic resumed on the Suez Canal, while investors awaited Thursday’s output meeting of OPEC and other major oil producers. Observers were also tracking fallout from the sale of billions of dollars worth of stock by troubled US fund Archego, which left several creditor banks exposed to huge losses, including Nomura of Japan and Switzerland’s Credit Suisse. App-driven food delivery company Deliveroo is meanwhile set for London’s largest stock market launch in a decade with a valuation of £7.6 billion. Deliveroo’s initial public offering due Wednesday will be priced at £3.90 per share, a source close to the matter said Tuesday. That values the Amazon-backed British group at the equivalent of 8.9 billion euros or $10.5 billion. With big data announcements due also this week, analysts said traders were largely biding their time awaiting the next catalyst to drive buying, though most tip the year-long rally across equities to continue this year despite recent stutters. The major call is Friday’s US government employment report, which will give a fresh snapshot of the world’s top economy as it slowly emerges from the crisis. Also in focus is US President Joe Biden’s much-anticipated infrastructure bill, tipped to be worth as much as $4 trillion and which follows his vast stimulus package. The expected spending spree by the US government comes as Biden pledged that 90 percent of American adults will be eligible for vaccination by April 19. His goal of getting 200 million people jabbed within his first 100 days also appeared to be well on course. Still, the threat that the economic reopening will see a huge jump in spending continues to weigh on market sentiment as traders fret it will force the Fed to tighten its belt earlier than 2024, as flagged. US inflation remained stabilised for now, with data last week coming in below expectations. But markets analyst Louis Navellier noted that “China is starting to raise the price of some of their goods,” and added, “we do have inflation out there brewing.” – Key figures around 1130 GMT –
