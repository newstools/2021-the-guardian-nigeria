Earlier in Yenagoa, Epe narrowly lost to Vincent Torgah in the 2021 Bayelsa State Governor’s Cup tournament, which held at the Seriaki Dickson Golf and Country Club, Yenagoa. Speaking after his win Port Harcourt, Epe said after the Bayelsa disappointment, he decided to work on his swing, which eventually paid off. “I came into this tournament with determination for victory after losing narrowly to Vincent Torgah in Bayelsa last week. I discovered I had a problem with my swing and I had to work on it and it paid off. “I am grateful to God for the victory and I appreciate the organisers for a hitch free event,” Epe said. The weeklong event will be rounded off today with amateur’s event.
