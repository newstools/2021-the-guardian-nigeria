The Federal Government has said that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has no adverse effect. It said yesterday that it was monitoring reports from other countries on all coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, including AstraZeneca, which had been suspended by some European countries over concerns regarding the Batch ABV5300, adding that it was constantly in touch with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and experts for advice. The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, who disclosed this at a briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 in Abuja, noted that vaccination, which began in the country on March 5, had been uneventful with no side effect recorded in the country. Ehanire, who observed the President, Vice President, and other leaders who had taken the vaccine along with frontline health workers, said they were all doing very well, noting that their engagement helped to demonstrate to citizens that the vaccines the country received were safe. He warned that private importation of COVID-19 vaccines had not yet been authorised due to reports of substandard vaccines in circulation. The minister noted that all states, except Kogi, received a vaccine allocation in the last few days, while delivery to the service points was ongoing.
