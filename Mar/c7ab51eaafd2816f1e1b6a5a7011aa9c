Ortom had dragged Oshiomhole to court over his comments against him at a press conference held on July 27, 2018, where the APC stalwart accused him of having a hand in the death of two Catholic priests and other parishioners at Mbalom community in Gwer East local council of the state. Oshiomhole had also alleged that one of the priests had preached a ‘very critical sermon’ against Ortom. After filing six preliminary objections to the suit and losing all, Oshiomhole approached the court for an out-of-court settlement with Ortom. When the case came up for hearing yesterday, Ortom’s counsel, Samuel Irabor, informed the court that although the matter was fixed for a definite hearing, there was a new development on the out-of-court settlement deal earlier canvassed by Oshiomhole. He disclosed that Oshiomhole has complied with the terms of court settlement in part, stating that what remained was a retraction of the publication in the electronic media and some sundry issues. He asked the court for another date to enable the parties to resolve the outstanding issues. Counsel to Oshiomhole, Titus Akuha, who held the brief of Festus Jumbo, corroborated the submission of Ortom’s counsel. After listening to the submission of both counsels, Justice Ityonyiman adjourned the case to May 14 for a report on the out-of-court settlement deal.
