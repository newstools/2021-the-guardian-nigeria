Vin Diesel’s Son, Vincent Sinclair, Joins ‘Fast & Furious’ As Younger Dominic Vin Diesel’s 10-year-old son, Vincent Sinclair, will be making his big-screen debut this summer in ‘F&F9’, as the younger version of Vin’s character, Dominic Toretto. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Lil Vin’s playing the role of Younger Dominic and actually filmed his scenes way back in late 2019 when he was a budding 9-year-old Thespian. It is unclear how much screen time Vin Diesel’s son will get, but his minor’s contract says he got paid a daily rate of $1,005. There was a flashback to a younger Dominic already in ‘Furious 7,’ but the character was played by an actor named Alex McGee. The ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise, about a group of street racers, has raised more than $5 billion in global ticket sales since the first film. The film’s trailer was unveiled in February last year when the world went into lockdown due to a COVID 19 pandemic. Fast and Furious 9‘s original release date was slated for April 2020 but was pushed back to 2021 amid the coronavirus pandemic. The film is now scheduled to arrive on June 25 in theaters worldwide. Diesel is the father of three children with girlfriend Paloma Jimenez: two girls and one boy. His first daughter, Hania Riley, was born in 2008, followed two years later by a son, Vincent Sinclair, born in 2010. His third child, daughter Pauline, was named after the actor’s late Fast and Furious franchise co-star, Paul Walker. John Cena is set to join The Fast Saga as F9’s new villain, Jakob Toretto, but his connection to the central character indicates he won’t be a one-dimensional antagonist. Jakob, of course, is the younger brother of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who has served as a primary face of the franchise since 2001’s The Fast and the Furious. Considering viewers were unaware of Jakob’s existence leading up to F9, there’s still a ton of mystery surrounding Cena’s new character.
