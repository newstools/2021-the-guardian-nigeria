Four suspected bandits and a soldier died, when troops of Operation Hadarin Daji clashed with ‘criminal elements,’ on Thursday, in Marina Village, Safana Local Council of Katsina State. The Director, Army Public Relations, Mohammed Yerima, disclosed this in a statement, yesterday, tagged:  ‘Re: Many Soldiers Feared Killed As Bandits Storm Military Base In Katsina.’ He said reports that an “unspecified number of soldiers were feared killed in attack on a military post in Marina” were “false and unsubstantiated”. The statement read: “To set the record straight, troops of Operation Hadarin Daji, while conducting clearance operation against armed bandits and other criminal elements on March 4, 2021, engaged and successfully neutralised four armed bandits, captured arms and motorcycle during an encounter with the armed bandits in Marina village in Safana Local Council of Katsina State. “The unconfirmed number of armed men with an unspecified number of rustled cattle were sighted and intercepted along Batsari-Runka Road.  However, in an attempt to escape from the troops’ onslaught, the bandits sporadically fired at the troops’ direction, but the gallant troops responded with superior firepower followed by hot pursuit, thereby forcing the bandits to withdraw in disarray. “During the encounter, four-armed bandits were neutralised, while others escaped with various degrees of gunshot wounds. The troops also captured two AK-47 rifles and one motorcycle belonging to the bandits. “Regrettably, one brave soldier paid the supreme sacrifice during the encounter. Troops have dominated the general area and are trailing the escaping bandits.” Yerima said Army authorities commended the gallant troops for the successes achieved and their commitment so far.
