Burna Boy – 23 music video | Image: YouTube Nigerian Grammy-winning singer Burna Boy has released the official video for his song, “23”. In a timely release for Women’s History Month, which highlights the contributions of women to events in history and contemporary society, the Clarence Peters-directed video pays homage to women. The song, which appeared on his critically-acclaimed 2020 album, Twice As Tall, was inspired by basketball legend Micheal Jordan who wore the number 23 jersey while playing for the Chicago Bulls. Burna Boy also referenced this in the chorus saying the music makes him feel like Jordan – a way of saying he is a very successful and one of the greatest musician from Africa. That proclamation was affirmed when he won the Grammys at the 63rd ceremony of the Grammy Awards. He also managed to sneak in a snippet from his Grammy speech into the video. Watch below:  The album, Twice As Tall, is a mixture of Afrobeats, Afrobeat, dancehall, pop and hip hop. Primarily produced by Telz, along with production from Rexxie, Timbaland and DJDS, among others, it features guest appearances from Youssou N’Dour, Naughty by Nature, Sauti Sol, Chris Martin and Stormzy.
