 Director General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Sir Joseph Ari  If the proposal is currently receiving the attention of relevant authorities, the ITF will train over seven million Nigerians in the agriculture, construction, facility maintenance, information and communication technology, manufacturing, and service sectors between 2021 and 2031. The Director-General of the Fund, Sir Joseph Ari (KSN), stated this when he was briefing journalists at the ITF headquarters in Jos. According to Ari, the programmes will train about 12,000 Nigerians between three and six months in web design and programming, advanced computer networking, mobile APP development, ironwork, masonry, crop production, aquaculture, poultry, air-conditioning/refrigeration, plumbing, GSM repairs, and wig/cap making. Ari argued that until most Nigerians are equipped with competitive technical skills, “we will, as a nation, continue to fight a lost battle against the blight of poverty and unemployment and their attendant consequences. “Our belief is inspired by success stories from countries like Japan, Germany, Vietnam, Singapore, and Brazil that transformed into industrial powerhouses using technical skills. We can do the same. “As part of further efforts to equip Nigerians with requisite skills, the Fund entered into collaborations and partnerships with local and international organisations such as SENAI of Brazil, the Institute of Technical Education Services (ITEES) of Singapore, the Galilee International Management Institute (GIMI) in Israel, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Agency (NECA), the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) among others.
