Kidnappers operating in Takum Local Council of Taraba State are asking for N20 million for the release of two Christian Reformed Church-Nigeria (CRC-N) members in their custody. The two were abducted last Friday at Dogo Gawa village in Takum, where they had gone to purchase a cow for a thanksgiving service in the church. The Guardian learned that two of the church members that were sent for the purchase narrowly escaped from the kidnappers. Confirming the report to The Guardian via telephone, the Pastor of CRC-N, Jethro Musa, said the kidnappers demanded N10 million for each of the victims before they would be released. Musa, who said the church, in collaboration with security operatives, were working round the clock to ensure their release, beckoned the state government to tread extra legitimate miles in providing adequate security for the people. Expressing sadness at the development, the National Vice President of Christian Association of Nigeria, Dr. Celeb Ahima, stressed the need to beef up security in Takum. Ahima, who doubles as CRC-N president, called on worshippers and Tarabans at large to pray for the safe release of the victims and other persons still in kidnappersâ€™ den across the state. Some members of the church also expressed dismay that kidnappers have continued to reign supreme in the area despite the numerous checkpoints on the highways. Recently, about 27 travellers were abducted in the same Takum on their way from a church conference. This has forced commercial drivers to seek alternative routes. When reached for comment, the police command said it was leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that the victims regain their freedom.
