Seven allegedly killed in a week
The family of Jegede in Oke-Afa, Ejigbo area of Lagos, was yesterday thrown into mourning over the loss of their son, Kehinde Jegede, 20, who was killed by a commercial motorcycle rider who drove on one-way lane on Tuesday, March 9, 2021. Kehinde was said to have gone to buy recharge vouchers around 6:00pm on Kudirat Street, opposite Destiny Bus Stop, on the Canoe Road, when he was killed. The family of the deceased told The Guardian yesterday, that he was rushed to a nearby private hospital, but was rejected due to the level of injury. “By the time we rushed him to another hospital, he was confirmed dead,” a brother to the deceased, Abdulmumeen, said. “It still appears unreal to me. I could not sleep all through the night because I was hoping he would wake up. “If the government does not find solution, it will get out of hand. There is a demarcation that illustrates how vehicles should ply their route. The mind of an average person is already conditioned that a vehicle is coming in a particular way. My brother didn’t know that a commercial motorcycle was coming when he wanted to cross the road. “Unfortunately, while we were battling to rescue my brother, the Okada man escaped. These evil people are always on top speed that once they hit their victim, he or she would die instantly. “Several lives have been lost on this route. At least, you find five to seven people who are killed by these one-way riders. The sad thing is that, nobody is arresting or cautioning them. What has Lagos State turned to? Currently, you find Okada riders in places they did not ply before. They are everywhere now. Ajao Estate that was hitherto a no-go-area for them is now their domain. They drive recklessly. For how long are we going to continue living this way,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
