 Ifeanyi Okowa  Okowa gave the charge yesterday in Asaba during the swearing-in of the 25 chairmen in the state, saying the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) victory in the Saturday, March 6, 2021 council poll, demonstrated its supremacy in the state. He urged the chairmen to hit the ground running by formulating policies and programmes that would impact on the wellbeing of their people. “Do not abandon projects started by your predecessors. Instead, you can modify such projects to suit your taste. You should come up with ways to improve Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) without putting a burden on your people,” he said. While stressing the need for security as a means of boosting development, Okowa mandated them to make effortsdecisions to solve recent inter- communal crisis in areas affecting their constituency. He further cautioned that no council chairman would be permitted to live outside his local government headquarters to ensure smooth running of their administration. “Once again, I congratulate you on your victory in the elections and I wish you a peaceful and successful tenure in office,” he added. While giving the vote of thanks on behalf on the new council bosses, Chairman of Ndokwa-East Council Area, Ameachi Governor, assured Okowa that they would work in line with the blueprint of his administration. “Having reposed confidence in us, we will excel in our endeavors. I assure you that we will make you proud,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
