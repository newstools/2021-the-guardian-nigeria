A member of the House of Representatives, Aminu Goro, has called for more participation of Nigerian workers in politics. 
 
He said their participation in politics was important to continue to touch the lives of the downtrodden.  “We believed that God still has greater responsibility for him and all of us in his primary constituency, which is labour should rally round him so that he will succeed,” he said.
 
Oyelekan, who is also a vice president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), said labour can only succeed in providing good leadership for the country by the full participation of workers in politics and supporting those already identified among them.
 
He described him as one of the best political leaders in Nigeria as he has proved himself through innumerable works.
 
“If we identify anybody, we should all put hands together to push him up. The question should not be how much wealth you have acquired, but how many lives touched. If we have identified people doing well, we have to support such to lead and it won’t be out of place for us to recommend him for the governorship or even president because it’s a call to serve and we know that he will deliver,” he said.
