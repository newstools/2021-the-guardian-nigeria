 Enyimba and Rivers United will meet in the first leg of their Confederation Cup group stage qualifier in Aba…on February 14.  Enyimba campaigned in the CAF Champions League at the beginning of the season, but they lost in the second round to Sudan’s El Merreikh, which forced them to drop down to the Confederation Cup. Now, Rivers United must fight their ‘brothers’ to gain entry into the group stage of the less glamorous Confederation Cup. Speaking on the impending war with Enyimba, Rivers United Coach, Stanley Eguma, says playing against the Aba club on Valentines Day is an unfortunate development, which they must confront in the course of the championship. He said it would have been better for the two Nigerian sides to meet at the final stage of the competition rather than at this stage. However, Eguma is not fazed by the prospect of battling with their more successful counterparts, saying his players are ready to surmount every obstacle on their way to success this season. “We are not under any pressure ahead of the CAF Confederations Cup tie against Enyimba. But it is quite regrettable that Rivers United is contending with a Nigerian side at this stage of the championship. “I know the game against Enyimba will be tough, they have won the CAF Champions League twice, and notwithstanding their relegation to the Confederations Cup this season, I believe they have the experience to pose a big threat to us. “But Rivers United is not worried. Our focus is to work hard and win our games in the NPFL as well as the continent.” The first leg of the tie will hold in Aba on February 14, while Port Harcourt hosts the second leg.
