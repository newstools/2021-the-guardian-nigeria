His efforts have not only improved our ratings as the number one country in Africa, but it has also ensured that we qualified for the Olympics and Paralympics in Para, Canoeing and Para-Rowing. “Be rest assured of the ministry’s commitment and support to actualise the dreams of our athletes to win laurels for our fatherland. I have already marked the boat race to win two gold medals for us at the Olympics. We shall support your training anywhere in the country so that this dream can become a reality” The minister further said: “I’m most encouraged by your zeal and commitment, which is in line with our public-private partnership initiative. The birth of a new sports industry policy, which is the final stage of assent, would bring about changes that would attract sponsors and take care of the welfare of athletes. This should motivate other federations to key into the vision of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
