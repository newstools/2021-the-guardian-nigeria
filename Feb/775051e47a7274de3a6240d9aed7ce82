PHOTO Google image The Plateau Government has depopulated and closed five poultry farms at Dung Community in Jos North Local Government Area of the state. The steps were taken due to the outbreak of Avian Influenza, popular known as “bird flu”. Dr Shase’et Sipak, the Chief Veterinary Officer in the state, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Jos. According to Sipak, the decision to depopulate the farms came after samples taken from them tested positive to the pathogenic disease. He explained that birds from the farms were also killed and buried, adding that the farms have also been quarantined. “On Jan. 26, we got information about a suspected outbreak of bird flu at a particular farm in Dung. “We went to the farm, took samples and forwarded it to the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) for confirmation. “While we were investigating, other farms in the area were also infected. “On Feb. 2, all the results came out positive. “We immediately went to the five farms, depopulated them, killed all the birds and quarantined the farms,’’ he said. The official further said that the outbreak was suspected to have spread to Jos from Kano, alleging that a lot of merchants usually come from Kano to buy eggs in Jos. “From history, if there is an outbreak in Kano or Bauchi, it affects Jos and that informed our suspicion. “However, we have put in place a ‘traceback’ mechanism to ascertain the actual cause of the outbreak. “As I speak, another farm is being suspected at Bukuru, Jos South local government area of the state,’’ he added. Sipak also decried that the strain of the virus that currently infected the five farms in the state “is more deadly compared to the one that broke out in 2019’’. “This is why, in 2019, only two farms were affected. “But now, it is five farms, with more number of birds killed, and if care is not taking, more farms will be affected’’ he warned. The official called on poultry farmers in the state to observe all biosecurity measures in order to avert the situation and keep the pathogenic disease in the state at bay.
