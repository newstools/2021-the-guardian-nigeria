Zlatan and DJ Cuppy in “Gelato” music video DJ Cuppy has threatened to sue Afeare Israel, who is better known as Israel DMW, a personal logistics manager to Davido, over an accusatory post he made on his Instagram page. Israel, amidst an ongoing rift between DJ Cuppy and rapper Zlatan Ibile, had claimed that the disc jockey did not “duly reward” Zlatan for his contributions to the success of the hit song “Gelato” as well as Cuppy’s charity event. DJ Cuppy on her Twitter page stated that “For the record… There have been no breaches of my contractual agreement regarding the song #Gelato as confirmed by lawyers… However, as @IsrealDMW publicly inaccurately declared I owe an artist money, I am suing him for libel and defamation! See you in court Isreal.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1326669 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1301" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet.jpg 603w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet-588x598.jpg 588w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet-487x495.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet-236x240.jpg 236w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet-472x480.jpg 472w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DJ-Cuppy-tweet-590x600.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Israel had called Cuppy a “fake friend” and alleged that Cuppy did not give Zlatan Ibile a dime for their collaboration and even the fundraising event in Abuja. “Kudos to someone like Zlatan, who took a bold step by flushing a full fake friend like Cuppy who was just using his head all in the name of my papa na Otedola. Zlatan did a hit collabo with her, ordinary one kobo, he no see. “She also took Zlatan to Abuja for her fundraising where she made billions of naira and didn’t even remember Zee for one kobo until tomorrow. No accommodation, no feeding. “Zlatan had to even spend his own personal money at Transcorp Hilton to carter for everyone including me. Dis na 2021 abeg.” Israel’s post came after Zlatan Ibile had feign not knowing DJ Cuppy. When asked about their relationship on Soundcity’s ‘TheSwitch’ show, the ‘Lagos Anthem’ rapper said he didn’t know who Cuppy was. “Is that an artist?” he said. When asked if he doesn’t know Cuppy, the rapper responded by saying ”I don’t know her.” Cuppy had earlier bemoaned the rapper’s decision to block her social media. “10 months later and I sometimes still wonder why Zlatan Ibile blocked me on WhatsApp and Instagram without ever saying why; we were actually friends… “AND ‘Gelato’ was a hit! I’m human and I have feelings too,” she wrote.
