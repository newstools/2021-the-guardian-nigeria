To avoid herders and farmers clashes, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has advised the Federal Government to give a bailout to cattle rearing sector to establish ranches. The group added that Federal Government could ban open grazing after the bailout has been released. Its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement, decried the crisis between herders and farmers, which has generated severe tension over the years, aside resulting in open clashes with loss of lives and property in recent times. MURIC called on FG to use other options available to it, especially after state governments in the South rejected ranches and Ruga settlements. MURIC said: “State governments rejected donating land for ranches and Ruga settlements because nobody was prepared to pay for such land, and FG showed no intention to do so. It should be a private business, just like all other businesses. “But, herders and cow owners may not be willing or may lack the capacity to buy land for cattle grazing. Also, Northern traditional leaders have a role to play in persuading herders and cow owners to change their mindset and become willing to operate ranches. “Concerning financial capacity, this is where FG should come in. Federal Government should stoop to conquer. Such a bailout is not new and the herders/farmers conundrum necessitates it. After all, banks, airlines, private vehicle producing companies, petroleum importers and even farmers have received subsidies, bailouts and waivers in the past. It is now the turn of herders and cow owners and the time to do it is now.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
