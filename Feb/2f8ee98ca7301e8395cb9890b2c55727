 Abdullahi  Inuwa made the remark at the unveiling ceremony of the first Nigerian assembled Hyundai KONA Electric Vehicle, launched by the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) in Abuja. He said that creating an ecosystem was the only way to easily get the value that would enable growth, wealth and prosperity, citing the introduction of electric vehicles into the country, as a welcome development that would enable the nation to advance to a vibrant economy. Inuwa further said that the country needed to advance from assembling cars to building parts, adding that already NITDA was working with start-ups, young Nigerian entrepreneurs, to develop ground breaking ideas on automobiles, using Internet of Things (IoT), renewable energy, and other relevant emerging technologies. He recalled that the recent ground breaking National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Centre (NDIEC), established by the agency, was in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) of the Federal Government. He said that NDEPS, and other activities of government, was designed to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10  years. “The NDIE Centre is intended to provide facilities that would encourage inquisitive perspectives and create opportunities for entrepreneurs to transform their skills into products. “The centre will provide the opportunity for start-ups to accelerate their innovations, through design, thinking sessions and co-innovation workshops,” he added. He commended the Director-General of NADDC, Mr Jelani Aliyu, the council’s partners, Stallion Group, for their innovation and contributions to the technological advancement of Nigeria.
