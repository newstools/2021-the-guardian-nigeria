•Insists President being  ‘haunted by failures’ The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s alleged violation of his own COVID-19 law that imposes a six-month jail term on defaulters. Describing the reported breach as a “national embarrassment and gross failure of leadership”, the party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was “indeed scandalous that while Nigerians are striving to obey the COVID-19 regulation, which stipulates the compulsory wearing of nose mask and physical distancing in the public, they are being confronted with reports of open violation of the law by Mr. President at the All Progressives Congress (APC) membership revalidation exercise in his hometown, Daura, Katsina State on Saturday.” PDP added: “The media is awash with reports and pictures of Mr. President in public, discussing with his party leaders at the event without putting on a nose mask or maintaining social distancing as stipulated by the new law.” The main opposition party claimed that the development had shown that the Presidency and the APC were more interested in partisan politics than the health and wellbeing of the nation. “In this regard the onus lies on President Buhari and the APC to clean up the mess by tendering an unreserved apology to Nigerians and take steps to observe necessary regrets over this violation,” it added. BESIDES, PDP has faulted claims that some influential Nigerians were waging a smear campaign against the current administration. It declared that on the contrary, the President “is being haunted by his failures.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
