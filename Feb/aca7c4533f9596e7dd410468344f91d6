On this somber anniversary, we reaffirm a simple truth: Crimea is Ukraine,” Biden said. Russian troops seized the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine in 2014 and President Vladimir Putin then incorporated the region under Moscow’s rule. Simultaneously, the Kremlin backed an armed uprising in eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists declared independence, sparking a war that continues to simmer, with swaths of territory remaining out of the Ukrainian government’s control. In the latest fighting, two people were killed and two injured, the government in Kiev said Wednesday. The latest casualties came as Kiev accused Moscow and the separatists of using heavy weaponry and ramping up attacks in violation of a ceasefire agreed in July of last year.
