Operatives of Ogun Police Command, on Saturday, arrested one Sobola Olatunji, a 46-year-old staff of Remo North Local Government, for stabbing his 38-year-old wife to death on suspicion of infidelity. DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the spokesperson of the command, stated this in a statement issued in Abeokuta on Monday. According to Oyeyemi, the suspect was arrested following a complaint by the father of the deceased, one Alhaji Ambali Yinusa, who reported at Owode-Egba Divisional headquarters. He noted that the father of the deceased said his son-in-law Sobola Olatunji had misunderstanding with his wife, Momudat, which led to a physical fight between them. He stated further that in the process, Sobola Olatunji took a knife and stabbed his wife at the back. “Upon the report, the DPO Owode-Egba Division, CSP Matthew Ediae, dispatched his detectives to the scene where the suspect was arrested and the victim was rushed to the hospital for treatment. But while the treatment was going on, the victim gave up the ghost. “On interrogation, the suspect, who claimed to have married to the deceased for 20 years, alleged that he suspected his wife to have been having extra-marital relationship because of some text messages he saw on her phone. “He stated further that it was when he challenged his late wife about his suspicion that a quarrel broke out between them, which eventually led to the death of the mother of three. “The corpse of the deceased has been deposited at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital morgue for autopsy,” he said. He said that the Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun had ordered the immediate transfer of the case to Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
