Lil Frosh Sanni Goriola, better known as Lil Frosh, has been remanded in Ikoyi prison for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, Okeoghene Iyomaterie, who is also known as Gift Camille. The rapper on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to one count of assault at the Lagos State Magistrates’ Court in Yaba. In October 2020, Mayoks Michael, Camille’s manager and brother, accused Lil Frosh of beating her up. He made the allegation along with images of a badly bruised Camille. “You have done enough damage for almost a year now you have been in a relationship with my sister and client and you have brought her nothing but horror, pain and disaster,” Michael said on his Instagram page. This had prompted a heated backlash and widespread condemnation from prominent celebrities and fans on social media.

The Davido-headed label stated in a press release that it would never support or condone domestic abuse: “In light of recent allegations made against Mr. Sanni Goriola Wasiu a.k.a. Lil Frosh, we would like to state that as a record label, domestic violence is not a trivial matter and we will never support or condone such behavior. “There is no excuse for the actions of Lil Frosh and we understand that there is nothing that can be said or done to take away the insensitivity shown.” The Punch reported gathered that the 18-year-old rapper, who earlier denied the allegations, was invited by the policemen at the Federal Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Alagbon, on Thursday, February 4, 2021, for interrogation. Magistrate Adeola Olatunbosun, at the hearing on Tuesday, February 9, 2021, adjourned the case till March 9, 2021. She ordered Lil Frosh to be remanded at the Ikoyi Correctional Centre.
