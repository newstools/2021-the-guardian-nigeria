Natalia Bryant | Image: Instagram/imgmodels Natalia Bryant, the eldest daughter of late Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, has signed with international modelling agency IMG Models Worldwide. Bryant, 18, who recently marked the one-year anniversary of the untimely tragic deaths of her father and younger sister, Gianna, said she had always wanted to be a model. “I have always been interested in fashion since a very young age,” IMG Models quoted Natalia Bryant as saying. “I have a love for the industry and ever since I can remember I wanted to model. There is a lot to learn but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”   A post shared by IMG Models Worldwide (@imgmodels)  Natalia also posted the announcement to her Instagram stories, over which she exclaimed, “I am beyond thrilled and so honored to be a part of the IMG family!” Natalia’s mom, Vannessa Bryant, who’s a former model herself, reposted the news. “I’m so happy for you! I love you Nani,” she wrote. The news comes just weeks after Natalia Bryant turned 18, on January 19th. To mark her daughter’s special day, Vanessa shared touching throwback images of ‘daddy’s little princess’ with Kobe. Taking to Instagram, the 38-year-old posted two different pictures of herself with late husband Kobe and Natalia as a young child. The throwback photos saw Vanessa and Kobe sweetly pose with Natalia at the Lakers Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, in the early 2000s. “We love you so much! Happy birthday Natalia!!!! Our first born @nataliabryant,” she captioned it. IMG represents more than half of the highest-paid supermodels and celebrities such as Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, Lily Aldridge and more. Last month, the agency landed another high-profile client, when the company announced it had signed Ella Emhoff, the 21-year-old stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris and the daughter of second gentleman Douglas Emhoff.
