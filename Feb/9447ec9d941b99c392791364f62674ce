He added that three boys died after being swept away by the floods, and one girl drowned. Indonesia’s meteorological agency warned that Greater Jakarta — a region of around 30 million people that is regularly hit by floods in the rainy season — can expect more heavy downpours next week. “The river overflowed and brought a lot of mud… I have suffered great financial loss,” said Ali Fatullah, a fruit seller in the town of Bekasi on the outskirts of Jakarta. He said furniture and electronic devices were damaged by the water. Kurnianto said some 1,700 people remained in shelters, though many residents had started returning to their homes. Floodwaters had hit 200 neighbourhoods in the region, and 40 were still under at least one foot of water on Sunday. Jakarta saw some of its deadliest floods in years in January last year after downpours that also triggered landslides. At least 67 people in the capital and nearby cities were killed in that disaster.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
