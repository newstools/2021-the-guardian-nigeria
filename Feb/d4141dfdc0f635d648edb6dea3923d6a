MEANWHILE, the GreenLight Initiative has raised the alarm over lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and training for drivers who convey medical supplies, patients and logistics required for management of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Its Executive Director, Simon Obi, who stated this during training for truck and ambulance drivers in River State in collaboration with the Iwuanyanwu National Ambulance Foundation, Ministry of Health and Rivers State government at the weekend, maintained that the drivers were ill-trained and equipped. Obi explained that the training modules were designed to empower drivers and assist them with COVID-19 safety protocols, basic infection prevention control, basic first-aid, appropriate and rational use of PPE and education on road safety measures. He maintained that the training would enable the drivers to protect themselves from contracting COVID-19, enforce and advocate for COVID-19 safety protocols as they deliver on their jobs.
