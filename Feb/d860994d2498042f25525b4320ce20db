Cure My Nation Initiative, a non-governmental organisation, has advised the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to domesticate the Patients’ Bill of Rights to enhance quality healthcare delivery in the state. The group promotes rights of Nigerians in accessing medical services. The body’s Team Lead, Mr. Moshood Adewale who made the call during the official launch of the organisation, at Akobo, Ibadan, Oyo State, stressed the need for the domestication in order to prevent unnecessary deaths in the state.  He said: “We have written series of letters to the state government for it to send circulars to all the hospitals to comply with Patients Bill of Rights. We have reached the Chairman of House Committee on Health, Oyo State House of Assembly and the State Commissioner for Health for all the hospitals in the state to comply with Patients Bill of Rights. We enjoyed the support of the commissioner to the effect that they have created a particular office where people can seek redress in case of violation of the legal framework. “We are imploring the state government to implement the Patients Bill of Rights for the benefits of the masses.  If the masses get to know their right whenever they visit any hospital, it will bring about an improved healthcare service delivery and it will complement the efforts of the government in term of quality health delivery.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
