Task govt. on strategies to stimulate investment With the gradual return of bulls to the stock market, operators have renewed call for the government to develop focused strategies targeted at boosting operations of listed firms, to stimulate investments and sustain the current rally in the market.
 
The operators, who spoke against the backdrop of an unprecedented rally witnessed in the market since the second quarter of 2020, maintained that this is the appropriate time for the government to implement policies that would help revive the primary market segment and attract new issues into the market.
 
According to them, initial public offerings (IPOs) will boost investment interest and stock market average in terms of volume of activities and contributions to the gross domestic product (GDP), which is currently rated low when compared to other emerging markets.  “Although IPO activity was mute, the value of supplementary issues increased dramatically from 2019, rising by 851.37 per cent to N1.42 trillion, from N148.77 billion.
 
“Also noteworthy is that for the second consecutive year, equity market transactions were dominated by domestic investors, who accounted for 65.28 per cent of market turnover by value (Retail: 44.98 per cent; Institutional: 55.02 per cent) while foreign portfolio investors accounted for 34.72 per cent.
 
“Capital-raising activities in the fixed income market increased significantly in 2020. The NSE’s bond market capitalization rose by 35.52 per cent from N12.92 trillion in 2019 to N17.50 trillion.”  He argued that for issuers to approach the market to raise capital there must be some reasonable level of recovery in the economy to sustain the current bull run.
   
He added that there was a need for the government to initiate strategic policies that would grow businesses in Nigeria, while stockbrokers must also ensure that issuers raise money in a manner that is competitive and less expensive.
 
“We need an economy where issuers can see growth. The growth must impact on their businesses and it is when the business expands that companies can approach the market to raise capital.” Specifically, he charged the Federal Government to re-strategise and address current macroeconomic concerns impeding economic stability and promote issues of national development, to tackle prevailing stock market volatility, restore the market to sustainable rebound, and attract new issues to the nation’s bourse.
