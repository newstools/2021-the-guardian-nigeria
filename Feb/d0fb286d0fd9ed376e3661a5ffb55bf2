The Centre for Social Change and Economic Development Nigeria (CSCED) says it is training 600 farmers and herders on alternative feedstock and commercial opportunities from its value chain development in Taraba to mitigate farmers/herders crisis in the state. Alhaji Mustapha Baba, the team leader, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Jalingo on Saturday. Baba said that 20 agricultural extension workers which were already trained in 2020 had finished refresher course for the outreach extension training for 600 farmers and herders on alternative livestock fodder/feedstock and other opportunities.
According to him, the training is being conducted in collaboration with with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the ministries of Agriculture of Taraba, Benue and Nassarawa states where the programme is being implemented. “We commenced the outreach training  of the farmers and herders in the most vulnerable areas of farmers/herders crisis in the state. “The extension workers are grouped into three based on the three senatorial zones of the state to handle the outreach training which is expected to be completed in four weeks where each of them we are training at least 30 farmers and herders,” he said.
He explained that the main aim of the training which was  supported by United Nations Peacebuilding, United Nations Development programme (UNDP), United Nations Human Rights Commission and UN Women, was to curb farmers/herders crisis in the country.
The team leader said the formulation of alternative feeds using ammonia, urea and aroma therapy would help to reduce the conflict over natural resources and enhance nutrition for the animals and fertility of land for the farmers.
