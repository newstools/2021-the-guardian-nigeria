Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has vowed to ensure that all alleged looted funds from the state coffers by former governors and their cronies must be recovered. Uzodimma, who addressed a cross section of Imo people during a stakeholders’ meeting, held at Imo Council of Traditional Rulers Council hall, Owerri, recounted how former governor, Rochas Okorocha attended his inauguration on January 15, 2020, requesting the disbandment of panels probing past leaders, adding that he rejected the plea from the former governor, now senator. He also disclosed that the sealed Spring Royal Palm Estate and Apartments owned by the former governor’s wife was worth N5b. In the meeting chaired by a former governor, Ikedi Ohakim, and attended by some former deputy governors; Dr. Douglas Acholonu, Ebere Udeagu, Ada Okwuonu, Jude Agbaso; the Speaker, Imo State House of Assembly, Paul Emeziem and his deputy, Amarachi Iwuanyanwu, among others, Uzodimma wondered why Okorocha disregarded the panels’ invitations during their sittings, only to do things by brute force.
