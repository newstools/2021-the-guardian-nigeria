Participants at a virtual media roundtable on gender and electoral reforms yesterday  called for amendment to the Electoral Act to make it mandatory for political parties to include women, persons with disabilities and youths in their candidates list. The meeting, organised via webinar by the International Press Centre (IPC) and supported by European union (EU)-funded Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (SDGN), also brought together Yiaga Africa, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) other EU-SDGN partners. More to the amendment, as further suggested by the forum, should be to make it mandatory for political parties to ensure 50 per cent inclusion of both genders as delegates in their primaries.
