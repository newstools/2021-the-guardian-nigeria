The Newspapers and Magazines Distributors Association of Nigeria (NDAN) has asked media houses and government should collaborate with them in gathering data and carrying out their duties. The association also urged them to provide an enabling environment for distributors and vendors. Chairman of NDAN, Lagos Island Zone, Godwin Akpan, who made the requests during his swearing-in ceremony at the weekend, further said that the government should empower and educate distributors and vendors in their operations and reduce the cost of newspapers and magazines production, especially newsprint so that the cover prices could also come down for people to be able to afford it. He also asked government and media houses to provide insurance cover for vendors in case of an accident. “Newspaper distributors and vendors’ population runs into millions nationwide. In Lagos State alone, we are approximately two million. No nation can afford to disenfranchise such a large group of people from participating fully in the real sector of the nation’s economy,” he said.
