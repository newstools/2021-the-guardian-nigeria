I’m sure we will. “I don’t think any ethnic group should lord it over the other. The South west zone should not lord it over the north, the north should not lord it over the south. We should respect each other’s trade, geographical space, history and culture. More importantly, the issue of crime, particularly murder, should be completely jettisoned. “We all have to discuss this matter and look for the way forward. I think everybody is willing to do that.” The Speaker, who hailed appointment of new service chiefs by President Buhari, described it as a welcome development which would find favour from National Assembly. Gbajabiamila said: “The National Assembly will not in anyway put hurdles before the service chiefs. We will work the working environment suitable for them to be able to discharge their responsibilities very efficiently. “The appointment of new service chiefs is what everybody had been clamoring for, the House, Senate, public. The President took his time and he studied the situation very well and did it at the time that he thought he should do it and we are in support of what he has done.” On the All Progressives Congress (APC) membership revalidation, the Speaker urged members to register to partake in 2023 political arrangement in the country.
