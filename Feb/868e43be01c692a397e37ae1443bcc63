NBA ALL-STAR VOTING RESULTS  Fans accounted for 50 percent of the vote to determine the NBA All-Star Game starters, while current NBA players and a media panel accounted for 25 percent each.  James (5,922,554 fan votes) and Durant (5,567,106 fan votes) led their respective conferences and position groups in fan voting.  Curry (5,481,033 fan votes) and Beal (3,485,051 fan votes) also led their respective position groups in fan voting.  After all votes were tallied, players were ranked in each conference by position (guard and frontcourt) within each of the three voting groups – fan votes, player votes and media votes.  Each player’s score was calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fan votes, the player votes and the media votes.  The two guards and three frontcourt players with the best score in each conference were named NBA All-Star Game starters.  Fan votes served as the tiebreaker for players in a position group with the same score.  Dončić won the tiebreaker with the Portland Trail Blazers’ Damian Lillard for the second starting spot in the Western Conference guard group.  Below are the overall scores – based on results from all three voting groups – for the top finishers at each position.  Each player’s score is weighted based on 50 percent for fan vote, 25 percent for player vote and 25 percent for media vote.  The formula to determine a player’s score is (Fan Rank * 2 + Player Rank + Media Rank)/4.  For complete voting results and a list of media voters, please visit pr.nba.com.
