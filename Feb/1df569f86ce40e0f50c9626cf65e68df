This pandemic is one of those challenges and gives us an opportunity not only to get through the current crisis, but also to become more prepared and more resilient for the future.” Blinken said the United States would also “provide significant financial support” to Covax, a global plan to distribute vaccines to the poorest nations. Trump — who faced criticism for his handling of Covid in the United States, which has suffered the highest death toll of any nation — announced a pullout from the World Health Organization, saying it was beholden to China and did not do enough to stop the pandemic. President Joe Biden immediately reversed the decision although his administration has also pressed China to be more forthcoming to a WHO team investigating the origins of the devastating virus. “All countries must make available all data from the earliest days of any outbreak,” Blinken said. “And going forward, all countries should participate in a transparent and robust process for preventing and responding to health emergencies so the world learns as much as possible, as soon as possible.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
