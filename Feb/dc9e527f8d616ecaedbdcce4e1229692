This is a bespoke service that aims to fully cater to each member’s private healthcare by creating stress free solutions to all medical worries. From surgery to acupuncture, they provide a 360 service including a one-on-one doctor and nurse available, removing the waiting times and the uncertainty. The health facility is the new go-to service, with members including celebrities and royals, who value their privacy and the discretion Solice provides. Osagie-Clouard has practiced medicine for over a decade in New York and London, while gaining a PHD. “The importance of bespoke medicine is often highlighted when witnessing cases being mismanaged due to a lack of time and care given to each individual patient. Not simply hearing, but truly listening to their symptoms holistically, and drawing on our advisors to diagnose and treat problems precisely. “Our clients may be willing to pay for the best but like many of us, do not realise the workings of the medical industry as a business, and so may not always see the best specialist for them in any given circumstance; ultimately, no two clients are the same-and so the doctor or surgeon you see must be the best specific only to you. Solice health has also put the spotlight on minority groups in the UK, where English may not be their first language or cultural differences mean they have not expressed their pain and needs in the same way. With clients from the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe who at times find it difficult to navigate the workings of the private healthcare system, often paying for a battery of tests before getting to the root of the problem. To ensure clients are given the best care for their needs, Solice do not take commission from specialists they refer to, which is almost unheard of in the UK’s private healthcare; instead, they prefer to remain unbiased and thus unhindered when sourcing the best for their members. Being of Nigerian descent, raised in London and working in a male-dominated industry, Osagie-Clouard and her co-founders draw from their broad experiences to ensure the health and wellbeing of every client is bespoke to the smallest detail. In a time where we are forced to re-evaluate our needs, memberships like Solice stand out. Put simply by her clients, “this is what modern medicine should be; personalised, fast, discreet, and effective”.
