power The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says a total of 8.734 million Megawatts-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated in the second quarter of 2020. NERC made this known in its Second Quarter Report 2020 obtained on Wednesday by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos from its website. The regulatory agency said the total electricity generated during the second quarter of 2020 was 1.40 per cent higher than the energy generated during the preceding quarter. The commission said: Within the same quarter, the industry recorded a peak daily generation of 5,316MW. ” The available plant generation units increased to 73 from the daily average of 66 units recorded in the
preceding quarter. “Although the increase in the available generation units in the second quarter of 2020 led to 1.40 per cent increase in the total electric energy generated, the capacity utilisation rate fell by 8.16 percentage points during the said period.” According to the agency, this reduction is attributable to constraints relating to gas supply shortage, and transmission and distribution networks bottlenecks. NERC said the constraints had continued to pose major technical and operational challenges to the industry. It also disclosed that there were two incidents of total system collapse (total blackout nationwide) during the period under review compared to one incident recorded in the preceding quarter.
