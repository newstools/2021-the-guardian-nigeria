Players of Nigeria’s U-17 national team, Golden Eaglets, will go through another round of Magnetic Resonance Imaging testing  (MRI) to revalidate their true age before the team depart for the African U-17 Nations Cup scheduled for Morocco next month. Team officials confirmed yesterday that FIFA has directed the Coach Fatai Amao tutored side, who resumed camping in Abuja last week ahead of the championship, to go through the compulsory MRI scan. According to the media officer of the team, Francis Achi, “the players had COVID-19 tests before being allowed to enter the camp last week. The team is 100 percent focused in training ahead of the African championship. The coach did not invite new players to the team.” The Golden Eaglets qualified for the African championship in Morocco from the WAFU B championship in Lome Togo.
