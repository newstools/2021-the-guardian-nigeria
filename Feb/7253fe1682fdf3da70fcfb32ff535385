Gunmen, suspected to be herdsmen, reportedly abducted a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Kelvin Mordi, on Saturday in Emuhu, near Agbor, along Benin-Asaba Road, Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State. It was gathered that the abductors had demanded the sum of N10 million to release their victims. Residents of the community lamented that despite police and military presence on that route, bandits were still on the rampage. The couple, whose marriage was slated to hold last Saturday, were kidnapped alongside other victims by the bandits who attacked their vehicle heading to the marriage reception. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said the victims were heading for a wedding in Benin when they were kidnapped. She said: “They were travelling to Benin for a wedding when they were attacked. They were not the one getting married. They were guests.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
