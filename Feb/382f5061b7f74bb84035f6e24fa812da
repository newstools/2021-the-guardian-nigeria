It is bad that schools are no longer safe in the country following the mass abduction of pupils from Chibok, Borno State in 2014, to Dapchi in Yobe, Kankara in Katsina and lately Kagara in Niger State.
 
It is worse and troubling that orphanages and homes have now become targets. Criminals have included the shelter for the vulnerable children and orphans in their checklist of terror.

Aged between nine and 14, the children were picked up between 1a.m. and 2a.m. from Rachael Home for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Abaji.
