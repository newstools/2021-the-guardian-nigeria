The case of 15-year-old Blessing Ihejirika, daughter of Staff-Sergeant Innocent Ihejirika, who is currently among the soldiers defending Yobe State from insurgents, has won the favour of the Nigerian Army, as it has decided to sponsor medical treatment in India. Blessing is suffering from cancer of the blood, and until she was referred to Artemis Hospital, Jacobpura, India for a bone marrow transplant, was taking chemotherapy at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). According to a brother of Innocent Ihejirika, Emmanuel Ihejirika, while Blessing and the mother had received their passports, two donors of bone marrow are yet to get theirs. But Blessing bleeds through the mouth, which, according to LUTH, is caused by shortage of platelets.  Blessing needs platelets urgently before their departure. Kind-hearted Nigerians are called upon to donate through Blessingâ€™s mother, Good-seed Ihejirika, via her account, GTBank 0615685653.  She can also be reached on 08060584460.
