 People lay flowers in memory of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov at the Solovetsky Stone, a monument to political prisoners in Saint Petersburg on February 27, 2021. – Hundreds of Russians and diplomats of Western countries marked in Moscow on on February 27, 2021, the sixth anniversary of the assassination of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov was one of President Vladimir Putin’s loudest critics until he was shot and killed on a Moscow bridge near the Kremlin on February 27, 2015.

In 2017, a court found a former security force officer from Chechnya guilty of Nemtsov’s murder and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. Four other men were found guilty of involvement in the killing. But the slain opposition politician’s family and supporters insist the authorities have failed to bring the masterminds to justice. Blinken paid tribute to Nemtsov as a man who “dedicated his life to building a free and democratic Russia.” “Those who would speak out in defense of their freedoms and democracy in Russia continue to be targeted for attack and assassination,” he said. “The Russian people deserve better.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
