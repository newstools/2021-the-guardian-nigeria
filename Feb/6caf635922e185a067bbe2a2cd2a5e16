Briefing State House Correspondents at the end of FEC, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, his Federal Capital Territory (FCT) counterpart, Mohammed Bello and Water Resources Minister, Suleiman Adamu, gave details of the figures attached to the projects. Fashola said council approved all four memoranda he presented on the Benin-Ore-Ajebandele Road, particularly the Adebamdele-Shagamu section, saying the contract was first awarded in 2014 by the previous administration. He explained that the specifications needed to be changed to complete the project, particularly the shoulders and pavement as originally conceived to support the kind of trucks and tonnage on the expressway. The minister pointed out the redesign of the shoulders and pavement provision necessitated a revised estimated cost of N22.8b from the initial N71.6b to N92.5b, adding that the FEC also approved contract for the Akwanga-Keffi-Makurdi highway, among others. Speaking, Bello disclosed that his ministry presented five memoranda, all of which were approved, including review of the N19.5b Southern Parkway project Institute and Research District, Abuja, Housing National Defense College, Legislative Institute at N3.4b and eight months completion period. “The FEC approved contract for the access road and car park for Abuja Light rail stations, Kagini Station at N1.8b to be completed in 12 months and upward review of the contract sum for the Southern Parkway from Christian Centre (S8/S9) to Ring-road from N16.2b to N19.5b to be delivered in 24 months, among others,” he said. On his part, Adamu said council approved the Fika Gadaka Water Project in Yobe State, saying the project, which started in 2003, was abandoned in 2007 at 30 per cent completion. He noted that the FEC also approved the revision of the consultancy contract for the supervision of Gere Earth Dam in Katsina, which he said, was also an inherited project. “Council in 2018 approved the revised estimated total cost for the project towards its completion and so it also makes sense that the consultants supervising the projects should also have their services extended. “FEC also approved the extension of consultancy services of Emplan Group by another 36 months with an increase of N310m for consultancy fees,” he added. MEANWHILE, the FEC observed a minute’s silence in honour of the late former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande. Before the commencement of the virtual meeting, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha invited members to honour the deceased, who served in the council between November 1993 and March 1995 as Minister of Works and Housing. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, six ministers and some senior aids of the President Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd.) were physically present the meeting. Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan and other ministers participated virtually from their offices in Abuja.
