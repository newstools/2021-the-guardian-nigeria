Ali has since been arrested and taken into custody by the police,” it stated.

The commissioner said the report received by the government indicated that the locals fled the area on receiving information that some terrorists were sighted outside the village. “On getting to the location, the armed bandits had set ablaze the place of worship and the two houses.“The governor has directed the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency to urgently assess the damage done and take appropriate action. Security agencies will sustain patrols in the area.” He stated.
