 Fist that signifies unity, revolution. PHOTO: GOOGLE  Those who have warned of the possible collapse of the Nigerian state know of the existence of disintegrating factors in our polity. They know that the minutest of disagreements have ominous implications for peace and order in our society.

The article, I believe, is more relevant today than it was when I first wrote it. “The participants may have cultivated the habit of interrupting one another rather crudely, but this has not in any way diminished the usefulness of the discussion panel hosted by Gbenga Aruleba on the African International Television channel. A recent discussion of great interest was on whether or not the geo-political zones created by the government of the late General Sani Abacha in 1995 should be accorded a constitutional recognition.

It is not uncommon in the Western world to hear people say, “my parents were from Pakistan, but I was born in London”, or “I was originally from New York but now I am a Washingtonian”. In fact, people proudly wear T-shirts with the names of their cities or towns inscribed on them. There would have been no reason for the lady from Ile-Oluji not to enthusiastically flaunt her place of birth if ours were not a society where danger and disadvantages await “unwelcome sojourners”.
