Photo: CORRUPTIONREPORTER  Following a suit number ABJ/CS/196/2021, filed by a legal practitioner, Osuagwu Ugochukwu, the Federal High Court in Abuja has given the Senate and Bawa 30 days to prove why the appointment should be sustained. The lawyer is seeking two principal reliefs, including a true interpretation and construction of Section 2(1)(a)(ii) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act 2004, whether Bawa is qualified to be appointed chairman of the anti-graft agency and whether the Senate is competent in law to confirm the appointment of Bawa, who is deemed to fall short of the requirement of Section 2)(1)(a)(ii) of the EFCC Establishment Act 2004. Osuagwu also seeking three declarations to determine the fate of the suit, including that Bawa is a Grade Level 13 public officer and not an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) or it’s equivalent and therefore not qualified to be chairman of the Commission, as well as an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Senate from confirming Bawa’s appointment as chairman of the EFCC and any other order(s) the court may deem fit in the circumstance. The suit, which came through an originating summons, has since been served on the office of the Senate President, with proof of service acknowledged on Thursday, February 18. Bawa was due for confirmation hearing at the Senate on Thursday, but his nomination has been dogged by several petitions allegations against him.
