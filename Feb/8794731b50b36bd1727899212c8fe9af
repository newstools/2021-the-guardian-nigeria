 Victor Decker | Image: Instagram/brightwonderhdfa  Decker was found dead in his apartment yesterday by his neighbours at about 5 pm. According to Jesse Nazareth, the Mayor of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Abuja, said that the actor’s neighbours had to break down the door to his apartment before they found his lifeless decomposed body seated in his sitting room. “I just got a call that his neighbours did not see him for days so they got concerned. They went to his house, knocked on his door but got no response so they had to break down the door. That was when they saw him sitting on his chair lifeless. He was already smelling as he was decomposing,” Nazareth told The PUNCH. Maina Marcus, the Vice President, Actors Guild of Nigeria, North East, confirmed the news in a telephone chat with PREMIUM TIMES. “Actors Guild of Nigeria, Abuja regret to announce the death of one of our veterans, Elder Victor Decka, his remains were found in his house at Kubwa on Tuesday and have been deposited in a morgue at Bwari this morning,” Marcus said. Reacting to the news of Decker’s death, actor Uzee Usman, wrote on his Instagram page: “Speechless! Can’t believe I’m typing this! But a reminder that this is not our home, we’re all on a journey! This is how I chose to remember you! Goodnight general! Rest In Peace!” Until his death, Decker was a member of the Abuja branch of the Actor’s Guild of Nigeria (AGN). The septuagenarian had starred in films such as “Double Strings”, “If I am President” and “Lotanna”.
