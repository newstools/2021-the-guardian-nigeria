AFRO-POP star, Joseph Akinwale Akinfenwa, known professionally as Joeboy, will today discuss his recently released his long-awaited debut album entitled Somewhere Between Beauty and Magic, on Cuppy’s Apple Music Radio show, ‘Africa Now’. The rave-making singer will discuss the 14-track project, which is the official follow-up to his 2019 Love and Light EP debut, a testament to the ability of Mr Eazi’s emPawa initiative to unearth him as a musical gem. He will also speak on why the album has no features and his plans for a deluxe. As regards the lack of features on the album, singer cum songwriter said: “I really, really wanted two of my favourite artistes on the album, but I couldn’t get their verses on time. So, by the time they submitted their verses, it was too late to actually add it to the album.” According to him, the two favourite artistes are Simi and WurlD. He added that deluxe version of the album will be coming out in a couple of months. “So those features are definitely going to be on it,” he said. Commenting on the album title, the singer said: “The whole idea behind the album is love; love is beautiful and magical. You know the first project was Love and Light. So, we (I and Oxygen Mix —my mixing engineer) were speaking about what we should name the next project. “We were in Ghana riding quad bikes somewhere, and Oxygen was like this place is ‘beautiful’ and I’m like, ‘Yo. I think we should name it ‘beauty and magic’; let’s call it somewhere between beauty and magic, and it kind of stuck.” “Another reason why we settled on the name is because the album consists of songs that are about different parts of love. Love is beautiful. Love is magic. These were songs I made with those influences. “I promise you, I genuinely do not care if it is one-minute. If it is sweet, it is sweet. There is no deliberate reason behind it; it is not something I plan. To be honest, it stops when it stops and if it is the
re, I don’t try to force it to make it three minutes,” he added. Joeboy’s discovery by Mr Eazi in 2017 was hinged on his performance in Ed Sheeran’s global hit, Shape Of You. After what may be considered a false start with the Mr Eazi-assisted Faaji, his spotlight moment came with his 2019 continental hit, Baby, which gained heavy recognition in East Africa before rising to the peak in Nigeria. Since then, the singer has been on a never-ending rollercoaster, releasing hit singles such as Beginning, Don’t Call Me Back and a five-track EP titled Love and Light. He has also ascended into popstar royalty, winning the hearts of girls across the continent, even as he amassed a reputation for making songs that are short and to the point. His music, often love-centric, contains infectious melodies that spread warmth and joy; little wonder he has accrued almost half a billion streams across streaming platforms. On what next, Joeboy said: “The plan generally is to promote the album, shoot videos, and then move to phase two of my career. I just want to help others. If I see a song I really like, I would jump on it and maybe shoot a video for something. I’m not trying to sign anybody though. There also might be a deluxe version of the album. It is possible this year; I think six months space is enough time to drop another one.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
