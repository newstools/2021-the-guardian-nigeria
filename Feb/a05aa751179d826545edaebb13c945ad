The Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria (POFON) has commiserated with Mr Fatai Afolabi, its former Executive Secretary, over the demise of his father, Alhaji AbdulRasheed Adisa Afolabi. A statement made available to The Guardian by the chairman of the forum, Mr Emmanuel Ibru, said: “We received the news of the demise of your father, Alhaji AbdulRasheed Adisa Afolabi, with profound sadness and would like to express our condolences to you in particular, and the Afolabi Family in general. Our hearts are with you and we share in your grief at this difficult moment.” The forum of palm oil and other tropical plantation owners said it joined Mr Fatai Afolabi in accepting the will of God.
“We also take solace in the fact and reality that Papa led a good and remarkable life, as exemplified in his gift of you, as a former Executive Secretary and now Consultant/Adviser to the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria (POFON) and Nigeria at large. “May I, on behalf of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria, express our sincere condolences as we pray to God to give you the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. We also pray for the soul of your late father to rest in perfect peace,” Ibru said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
