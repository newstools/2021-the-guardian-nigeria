 Nigeria IGP Mohammed Adamu  The signal for her sack originated from the Department of Finance and Administration in Ado Ekiti and was addressed to the Divisional Police Officer at Iye Ekiti, where Omolola was based.  However, the Chairman of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), Lagos, Comrade Kenny Abiola Bakare, said sacking the lady is not something Nigerians should drag too much. The action, he stated, is a matter of the police rule of engagement in respect of policewomen. “It is clearly written in the police act cap p19:(125) (127):2006, which has been amended recently that no special privileges are accorded to married policewomen. Also, unmarried woman police who becomes pregnant shall be discharged from the force and shall not be re-enlisted except with the approval of the IGP. This woman constable had gone against the rule,” he declared.   
   
According to him, being a new police officer who has not served long made everything very clumsy. However, Bakare said the only option available to the lady is to plead for pardon. “We will continue to lead to the IGP to extend a good gesture to her for pardon,” he suggested.
