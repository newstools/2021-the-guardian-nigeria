Lionel Messi also started in a front three alongside Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele, with the in-form Frenkie de Jong back in midfield after filling in as a centre back in recent weeks. PSG was boosted by the return of Marco Verratti, who was passed fit to start despite missing last weekend’s win over Nice with a hip problem. Neymar and Angel Di Maria were both ruled out injured for Mauricio Pochettino’s side, meaning Moise Kean joined Verratti and Kylian Mbappe behind Mauro Icardi at Camp Nou.
