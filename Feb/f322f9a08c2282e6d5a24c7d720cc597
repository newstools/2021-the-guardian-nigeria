But was unable to get across the finish line as Osaka reeled off four straight games to complete an improbable 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 comeback. “I mean, really the difference I feel like it was one point,” she said. “We had a lot of great points. I felt, of course, a little bit disappointing being 5-3 in the third set up, having match points “It’s never a good feeling losing a match that you feel you could have changed in one second. But I left the court with a good feeling, very good feeling of this tournament in general.” Two-time Grand Slam winner Muguruza had been in good form ahead of meeting Osaka and emerging as a serious championship contender. She reached the final of the warm-up Yarra Valley Classic and had not dropped at a set in this year’s Open before meeting Osaka . “When you’re younger, you’re disappointed,” said Muguruza, who lost in the final last year to Sofia Kenin. “(But) I feel like it’s just little details here and there that makes a difference with the top players. I think I’m on the right path. “Also the Australian swing, I played nine, 10 matches almost back-to-back. That was good. That was a good test for me physically, mentally,” she added. “I’m pretty happy with my performances.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
