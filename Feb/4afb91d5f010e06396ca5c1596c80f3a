The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dissociated itself from the debate on which part of Anambra State should get the governorship ticket. Addressing journalists at the party’s secretariat in Abuja, the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the National Working Committee (NWC) would not sit in Abuja and decide zoning of Anambra governorship ticket. According to him, when the time comes, aspirants will choose whether to step down or not, noting that as a party, the PDP is always ready to defend democracy. The PDP will not in any way support imposition of candidate(s) on the people, he pointed out. Ologbondiyan also dismissed reports of dispute among the NWC members on the stewardship of the party’s national chairman, Uche Secondus. “The PDP is a strong and united family that will resist any attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to sow seeds of discord within its ranks,” Ologbondiyan stated.
