West African Examination Council (WAEC) has released results of West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for private candidates. Head, Nigeria National Office of the council, Patrick Areghan, said that of the 61,509 candidates that sat for the examination, 31,751, representing 51.62 per cent obtained credit and above in a minimum of five subjects (with or without English Language and/or Mathematics) while 24,491 candidates, representing 39.82 per cent obtained credit and above in a minimum of five subjects including English Language and Mathematics. This represented 4.72 per cent increase in performance of private candidates in 2018 and 2019, as those who obtained credit and above in a minimum of five subjects, including English Language and Mathematics, constituted 35.99 per cent and 35.10 per cent. Areghan added that 66,375 candidates, representing a 31.63 per cent decline when compared with the 2019 entry figure, registered while 61,509 candidates actually sat for the examination at 540 centres spread across the country. He attributed the drop in the entry figure to negative impact of COVID–19 pandemic. “Out of the total number of candidates that sat for the examination, 61,111, representing 99.35 per cent, have their results fully processed and released, while 398 candidates, representing 0.65 per cent have a few of their subjects still being processed due to some errors on the part of the candidates.” Areghan said results of 5,548 candidates, representing 9.02 per cent, were being withheld in connection with reported cases of examination malpractice. According to him, the cases are being investigated and reports of the investigations would be presented to the appropriate committee of the council for determination. Areghan said the committee’s decisions would be communicated directly to affected candidates. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
