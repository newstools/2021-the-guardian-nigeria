Examinations at the Lagos State University have been put on hold after the Non-Academic Staff Union of the university started a warning strike over alleged breaches of agreement reached with the government. Students were locked out of the school premises which prevented them from writing their exams on Monday. The union had earlier in January went on a five-day warning strike by the institution Joint Action Committee to press their demands. The Chairman, SSANU-LASU Chapter, Saheed Oseni, said that the three unions in the university totally complied with the strike in line with the directive of their national bodies. ‎The three unions are the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, Non-Academic Staff Union and the National Association of Academic Technologists.‎ They said the university system is challenged by poor governance and administrative lapses which needs to be addressed holistically. “Poor funding of our universities, shortfall in payment of staff salaries, increasing corruption in the university system should be addressed,” the union said in January. The Dean of Student Affairs, Dr Tajudeen Olumoko, while addressing students, said that the school authority was already making contact with state government and the issue would be resolved soon.
