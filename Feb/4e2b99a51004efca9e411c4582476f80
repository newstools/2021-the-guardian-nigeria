Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a suit at the Federal High Court, Abuja against President Muhammadu Buhari and two others for allegedly using “draconian” provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 2020 to target activists. Other defendants in the suit are the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). SERAP is asking the court to stop Buhari from implementing “draconian and unlawful” provisions of CAMA 2020, which allow  the Federal Government to arbitrarily merge a new association with an already registered one.
