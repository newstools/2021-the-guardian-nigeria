He said the monies spent on the permanent Hajj camp comprised both the edifice and access road to the camp. “The building and facilities were constructed at the cost of N595 million, while the road linking the camp was constructed at a cost of N130 million. “The construction of the entire building and the road is at 95%  completion, about to be ready for use. The camp has a seating capacity of 1000, screening of 500 and 750 hostel capacity, with 250 for men and 500 for women,” he said. Mohammed said upon completion, the camp would provide employment and improve livelihoods for people. He noted that the permanent hajj camp was the biggest in Nigeria and the West African sub-region, equipped with befitting facilities. According to him, the National Hajj Commission had certified the Bauchi Hajj Commission as the Zonal office for the North East. Mohammed noted that both Christian and Muslim faithful would use the camp, given the fact that they had different timings for the transportation of their pilgrims. He stressed that his administration was committed to working for the people in all facets of life, to encourage peace and tranquillity, as well as make the state more attractive to investors.
