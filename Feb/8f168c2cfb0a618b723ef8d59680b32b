 Sanusi Garba  The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is set to review the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme as deployment suffers a setback.
  
In a consultation paper issued yesterday, and signed by the NERC Chairman, Sanusi Garba, the regulator said only 611,231 meters have been deployed under the MAP scheme as of January 31, adding that more than half of registered electricity customers in the country remain unmetered.
 
He said the purpose of the review is to look at the various options to fast-track the closure of the metering gap within the implementation framework of the MAP.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
