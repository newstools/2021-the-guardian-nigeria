The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has confirmed that the Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos, will remain totally closed till Monday night. According to FRSC, the closure was in a bid to conclude the ongoing rehabilitation on the bridge as earlier scheduled. The Federal Government had announced the total closure of the entire bridge for 72 hours from midnight, Friday, January 29, to midnight Monday, February 1. The Sector Commander, FRSC, Lagos State Corps, Olusegun Ogungbemide, said the reminder became necessary for the fact that some motorists still mistakenly drive towards the bridge despite the earlier release from the office of the Federal Controller Federal Ministry of Works & Housing, Mr Olukayode Popoola. Ogungbemide explained that the contractor planned to cast three expansion joints concrete during the periods. He said: “The closure is necessary because, during the casting and initial setting of the expansion joints, the bridges require zero vibration in order to achieve the desired strength of the concrete.” He explained that after casting the three joints and asphalting, the bridge will be reopened to traffic. Ogungbemide admonished members of the public to be patient and obey traffic officials. He stressed that men of FRSC and other sister agencies would continue to ensure a free flow of movement on all the alternative routes and prompt removal of impediments during the duration of the closure.
