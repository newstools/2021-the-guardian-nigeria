This month we invite you to join us, as we uncover the heroes behind the brands that millions of South Africans take into their homes and hearts every day. Being acknowledged and appreciated is everything and this April it’s the turn of Brand Managers on Biz.  Often the unsung driving force behind the brand, straddling strategy, budgets and stakeholder relationships, we invite you to nominate Africa’s favourite Brand Managers or marketers, deemed worthy of top story recognition on Bizcommunity.  Which brand managers or marketers have recently commissioned noteworthy campaigns, won awards, been recognised or ranked favourably by industry peers, contributed to sector growth or are leading with purpose?  Brand Managers will be asked to share with our readers about their recent brand campaigns and the rationales behind them, offering a great 360 lifecycle to stakeholders behind SA’s top brand stories.  If you are interested in giving your favourite Brand Manager the exposure they deserve, if the brands under their custodianship need to be seen as the leading in their sector or if you are interested in sponsoring this high value Biz Content Feature, email the editors at brandmanagerlove@bizcommunity.com naming the sector your brand plays in.  Candidates will feature on Marketing & Media home page and enjoy cross-posted exposure in their relevant industry sectors: BIZ COMMUNITIES / Marketing & Media / Africa /  Retail / Automotive / Agriculture / Construction /  CSI & Sustainability / Education & Training / Energy & Mining / Finance / Healthcare / HR & Recruitment / ITC / Legal  / Lifestyle / Logistics / Property / Tourism & Hospitality  In addition we will be adding an ongoing Behind the Brand Manager to our regular editorial columns so please send your suggestions and requests to brandmanagerlove@bizcommunity.com to be featured as a top story and social media channels.
