The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders’ Forum (SMBLF) has condemned attempted arrest of Yoruba rights’ activist, Mr.  Sunday Igboho by a combined team of security forces.
 
It was claimed that Igboho, who was on his way to Lagos, on Friday, for a scheduled meeting with one of the Afenifere leaders, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, was to be arrested by security agents but for the resistance of his loyalists.
 
In a statement, Spokesmen of SMBLF, Yinka Odumakin (Southwest), Isuwa Dogo (Middle Belt), Bassey Henshaw (Southeast) and Chief Guy Ikokwu (South South), said the forum noticed Department of State Service’s  denial in the media of its involvement in the  operation.  “That is an admission of the soft care for bandits by the government and pro-bandit supporters, who have been poking their fingers in the faces of non-bandit Nigerians.
 
“The President wasn’t aware of such caution in using maximum force against EndSARS, which they celebrated in Kaduna    
 
“It is also a demonstration of two sets of rules in the country, one for Fulani bandits and another for non-Fulani communities, who are being treated like conquered people.”
 
The added that if there is still serious authority in Nigeria, it is people like Shekau, Gumi and troublers of Nigeria, who should be under security scrutiny and not those who have committed no offence, known to law outside raising their voices against genocide going on across Nigeria.
