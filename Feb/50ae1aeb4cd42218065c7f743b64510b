The Director-General, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Moh-Lukman, is excited over the alleged inability by the former minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, to manipulate the All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders into accepting him to return to the fold of the ruling party. Fani-Kayode’s alleged attempt to defect to the APC met with stiff opposition from the PGF boss and several chieftains of the party, who felt it was tantamount to an insult on the values of the party. In a statement, titled, ‘APC and the question of values,’ the PGF boss said the rejection of Fani-Kayode surely earned respect for the APC and explains why it remains attractive to those angling for various positions of authority in the country. He said APC has ideological values aimed at strengthening democratic rule in the country, arguing that unlike other opposition political parties in the country, it creates enabling environment for internal contestation among its members to actualise their ambition. This, he said, underlined the gale of defections by politicians from the ranks of the opposition to the APC in recent time, adding: “That APC is succeeding in capturing power is the reason why we are having this debate. It is far more encouraging to engage the debate, on our part as APC members, because the party is succeeding in winning elections, if you like capturing power. Is there any successful political party anywhere in the world that is not an instrument of capturing power? “…Again, that we are as a party debating the issue of who should join our party or not represent the qualitative difference between the APC and PDP. If it were PDP, once the national chairman acts on a matter and backed by a serving governor, members can only grumble. “I am proud to have my voice guaranteed and affirmed by my leaders in APC. As an employee of governors, it has been a privileged opportunity to speak out openly on matters within the purview of leadership initiative. Rather than my leaders, including our governors, relating to me as a subordinate who should only take instructions, they recognise and respect my views as a loyal member of the party. “…There will be many instances of possibility that our leaders and our party may take wrong decision. Our capacity to correct those wrong decisions is what our politics require and not some fantasies. No amount of declaration, whether with reference to values or ideology can develop our politics, our parties, our democracy and our nation. “It is our capacity to get things done and especially get wrong actions corrected that can develop our politics, our party, our democracy and our nation. The issue of Fani-Kayode’s drifted attempt to join the APC is a clear instance of attempts to manipulate some of our leaders into accepting membership of someone who ought not to have been considered as member of our party. If that was the case in the past, it is better late than never to correct such a mistake. “…If you don’t agree with this position, abusing the APC, its leadership or members, including this writer, will change nothing. You are most welcome!”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
