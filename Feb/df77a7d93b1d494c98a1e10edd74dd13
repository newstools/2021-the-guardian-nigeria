“If you talk about the exercise, it has been good and perfect and the major exercise has just started today.
“However, we await report from the field so we can know how dedicated and loyal our members are toward the exercise. “We have faith on our members and I believe they will comply with the party structure,” he said. Obasa said that the exercise was like carrying out a population census because at the end of the day, it would be able to tell them the strength of each state, local government and ward across the country. He said by extension, the party would be able to tell the number of members in each state ahead of 2023 general election.
