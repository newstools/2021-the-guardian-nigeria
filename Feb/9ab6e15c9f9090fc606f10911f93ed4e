The hosts decorated the empty stands to say “Slavia Prague Fox Hunting”, but it was the visiting Foxes who looked more hungry from the start. Harvey Barnes set up Marc Albrighton outside the box in the first minute, but his low shot went wide. Barnes himself then sprinted past the Slavia defence on the left flank and into the box on 14 minutes, only to see his effort denied by diving goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar. Leicester made a single change from last Saturday’s 3-1 win over Liverpool as 19-year-old Luke Thomas replaced defender Ricardo Pereira. Slavia, who focused on pressing the visitors high up, were reduced to half-chances in the first half, with Danish winger Alexander Bah heading their best attempt wide. Slavia’s Romanian midfielder Nicolae Stanciu then sent a free kick right into Kasper Schmeichel’s hands before forcing a superb save from the Danish keeper an hour into the game. The Czechs kept pushing but centre back Ondrej Kudela missed from long range after a corner on 72 minutes. At the other end, Barnes chipped the ball over Kolar but missed the goal ten minutes later.
