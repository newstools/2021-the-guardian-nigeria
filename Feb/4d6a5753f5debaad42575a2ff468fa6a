Katsina State governor, Aminu Bello Masari, also said insinuations that ransom was paid for the boys’ release were false.
 
In a phone conversation with The Guardian, the Senior Special Adviser, Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications to Zamfara State governor, Zailani Bappa, said no money was paid to the bandits to release the boys. 
 
“If anybody gave them money, maybe it was from another state. The boys were released to Zamfara State government, and the discussion we had was that of understanding. For one and a half years, we have been getting people released without any ransom, and this is what we have continued to do with the bandits. We are not aware of any ransom, we are not aware of any money given out…”
 
He said Daudawa’s arrest had vindicated Matawalle over allegations that he was harbouring bandits.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
