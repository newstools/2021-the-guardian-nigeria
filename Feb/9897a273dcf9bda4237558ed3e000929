Because you’re not just beautiful, you’re strong. You’re grace and favour personified, and you’re so much more. “Words cannot properly express how grateful I am for you, how much I love you, or what we’ve been through. I’m thankful that you’re mine. And that God made everything beautiful in His time. He turned our tears into triumph, and our loss into laughter. He’s changed our lives forever, here’s to the next (and best) chapter. Nothing I can say or do can top what He gave us. My baby had a baby and he’s everything we prayed for. @adesuaetomi Happy birthday “Mama Zaiah” I love you SCATTER.” Adesua | Image: Instagram/adesuaetomi
