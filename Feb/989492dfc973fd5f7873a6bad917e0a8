Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has commiserated with the government and people of Zamfara over Friday’s abduction of 317 female students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe. Tambuwal was accompanied to Gusau on Friday by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III. The duo expressed shock over the abduction of the students which occurred in the early hours of Friday. Tambuwal described the abduction as “dastardly, pathetic and an abuse to human dignity”. He said the people of Sokoto state and indeed all other parts of the country share in the grief, noting that the people perpetrating these unfortunate acts should be ashamed of themselves. On his part, the Sultan, who was returning to Sokoto from the Northern Governors Security meeting in Kaduna along with Tambuwal, prayed to God to make all criminals better citizens in the country. Abubakar III urged the bandits to always have the fear of God in their ways of life. Responding, Gov. Bello Matawalle thanked them for their concern and brotherliness over the sad incident recorded in the state. Matawalle noted that the visit was a further demonstration that governors and traditional rulers were working to find lasting peace in all parts of the country.
