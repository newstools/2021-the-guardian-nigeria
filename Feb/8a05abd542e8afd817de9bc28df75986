• Gunmen abduct mother-in-law of Katsina-based business mogul, Mangal
The Cross River State Police Command has rescued an 81-year-old monarch, Muri Bassey Iyamba, from kidnappers.
 
Iyamba was whisked away from his house at Ambo by Idang in Calabar South Local Government area on Monday night.
 
The intervention by the police and the youth of the community led to his rescue around 4:00a.m. yesterday.
 
Narrating his ordeal to newsmen at the Diamond Police Station headquarters, Iyamba said: “Three men entered my compound pretending to be customers who came to buy chicken because we run a poultry, not knowing they came to kidnap me. Although I got information that some people wanted to kidnap me a month ago, I restricted my movement, not knowing I was still a target.  MEANWHILE, gunmen, in the early hours of yesterday, stormed Matazu Local Government Area in Katsina State and kidnapped Hajiya Rabi, the mother-in-law of renowned business mogul, Alhaji Dahiru Barau Mangal.
 
According to a family source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in Kano, the hoodlums arrived in the town around 1:00a.m. and went straight to the matrimonial home of Hajiya Rabi, where they whisked her away to an unknown destination.
 
According to the source, the gunmen had, before then, abducted the father-in-law of her son, one Buhari Muntari in Katsina town.
 
When contacted, the husband of the victim, Alhaji Muntari Masanawa, confirmed the incident to newsmen. Muntari, who is the traditional title holder of ‘Sarkin Yaki’ in Matazu, said the hoodlums who arrived at his house around 1:30a.m. woke his wife up and took her away on a motorcycle.
