BBC Remix | Image: Twitter/Blaqbonez Rapper Blaqbonez has shared the remix to his viral single, “BBC”, on which he enlists Afropop songstress, Tiwa Savage. The rapper on his Twitter page said he needed a female’s perspective, hence the remix. The remix is Blaqbonez’ first official release of this year, and the first sign of what to expect from his forthcoming album, ‘Sex>Love’ (pronounced ‘Sex Over Love’). Blaq and Tiwa trade verses about steamy trysts; with Tiwa expertly matching the energy of the song. The song features Blaq at his cheeky and provocative best; expertly toeing the line between risqué and sexy.  This past week, the rapper came bearing gifts as he visited Tiwa at her home for her birthday. Watch this hilarious video of their interaction with commentary by Blaq here!
