Reactions As Cardi B Releases First Single And Music Video Since “WAP” Cardi B has released her new single and music video “Up”, seven months after she broke the internet with “WAP”. At midnight on Friday 5 February, the artist dropped her latest track ahead of her highly anticipated new album, which is expected to come out later this year. In a YouTube live stream before the video premiere, Cardi B said she wanted the track to be more “hood” as her last one was “too sexy”. “I wanted to do something more gangsta, cockier,” she added. The music video opens with a funeral for 2020 before Cardi B is seen variously wearing a wig full of talking Barbie doll heads, holding a vibrator, and licking the tongues of her dancers.  Fans have taken to Twitter to say that they are “obsessed” with the song. “It’s absolutely breathtaking!” tweeted one person. “Omg you are honestly so incredible! I love you so so much! You’re outstanding in every single way! You outdo yourself every single time!” Another added: “If there’s one thing @iamcardib is going to do, that gives you some damn visuals!! Yes!! It’s #UP !” A third said: “I’ve been watching @iamcardib #up video on repeat.” More reactions below: Y’all @iamcardib with the HITS every time. #up — happy hoe.
