An energy company, First Electric, has restated its commitment to driving wide adoption of sustainable energy and water solutions across sub-Saharan Africa. General Manager, Sales and Marketing, First Electric, Shadrach Olarewaju, in a statement, emphasised the firm’s commitment to providing quality renewable energy products and services to meet the growing demand for residential Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Nigeria. With this, he said the firm had reduced financial barriers to adoption of solar solutions, by providing customers with flexible product financing and heavily invests in training and professional development to ensure its growing customer base benefit from quality sales and after-sales services. In areas with constant electricity supply from the grid, he said the firm’s hybrid inverters bring significant value as they can reduce cost on electricity bills by offsetting high electricity tariffs with a lower cost of electricity from the rooftop solar installation. This, according to him, is especially relevant to the recently increased electricity tariff. Through its product referral and solar installer programme, he added that the company empowers the youth and unemployed, which provides a source of income for interested subscribers. “First Electric has consistently advocated for renewable energy transition especially for residential homes to ensure reliable power supply without the drawbacks of hydrocarbon-based generating sets.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
