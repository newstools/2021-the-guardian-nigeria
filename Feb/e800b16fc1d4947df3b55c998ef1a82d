Facts have emerged that the kidnappers, who stormed a poultry farm at Oke Odan in Apete area of Ibadan, where they kidnapped Ayodeji Emmanuel, a 24-year-old son of the owner of the farm, have demanded N100 million ransom. The victim was kidnapped on Monday. Some suspected gunmen entered the poultry at Oke-Odan community, Apete and fired some shots into the air before abducting Emmanuel. A source in the community told The Guardian: “There was a reported case of kidnapping in a poultry farm around Apete. Information was gathered that the kidnappers and their three victims escaped through Balogun via Laniba and passed through University of Ibadan (UI) land (the open bush in between Ajibode and Laniba). “It is important to share this information for two reasons. First, for people to be aware that even inside town, Ajibode, Laniba, Balogun, and Apete, residents are no longer safe. Secondly is to call the attention of UI authorities to urgent need to clear the bush in between Ajibode and Laniba in order not to create a safe haven for criminals”. It was gathered yesterday that the abductors used the phone of their victim to call his father to request ransom. It would be recalled that Oyo State police command had on Tuesday said it was intensifying efforts to rescue the victim.
