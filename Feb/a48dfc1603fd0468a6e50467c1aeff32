The then 20-year-old fresh graduate of Kwara State Polytechnic, Miss Zainab Idris, who came to The Guardian in February 2019 to seek financial support for a corrective surgery on her two legs, has returned to appreciate Nigerians who bailed her out.
 
Her medical report, signed by Dr Izuagba E.B of the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, had said she needed N925,000 for the operation.
 
Zainab’s mother, Mrs Adenike Idris, who accompanied her to Rutam House, head office of The Guardian newspaper, said the travail began when Zainab was 11 days old.
 
Returning to The Guardian with her mother to show gratitude to Nigerians for the support, Zainab, who still uses walking stick as recommended by the doctor, said the operation was done in December 2019.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
