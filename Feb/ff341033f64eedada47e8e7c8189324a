Critically acclaimed British rapper, singer and songwriter Stefflon Don has released “Can’t Let You Go” remix featuring Nigerian artistes Tiwa Savage and Rema. “Can’t Let You Go” is Stefflon Don’s second release this year after “Move”, her first new music in 2020.
Stefflon Don said of her inspiration for the single, “For this track, I wanted to lean into my natural singing voice and also experiment with doing some of the melodies in Yoruba. The overall vibe of the track is underpinned by a sultry Afro Beats sound. I always love to fuse all of my cultural influences into my work, because I am very much inspired by different parts of the world”. The video accompanying the track is directed and animated by Ben Dosage.
