The Ogun State Government has approved the resumption of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) activities in the state.
  
The Chairman, Ogun State Park and Garages Development Agency, Habib Ajayi, who disclosed this in Abeokuta, said the government has no problem with the NURTW, led by Alhaji Mustapha Ismail, popularly known as Yaro, to function as a union in the state.
  
Ajayi, while reacting to planned commencement of union activities in all the parks and garages across the state on Monday, noted that although there was an internal crisis among the members of the union, but it was resolved during the opening of the union secretariat in Asero, Abeokuta, last year.
  
He further said that the state government does not exactly interfere in the activities of unions, but park managers monitor and implement government policies in parks and garages across the state.
  
Ismail commended the government for the development, assuring that his members would not engage in violence at parks and garages, adding: “So, I urge all members to shun violence. Anyone that engages in fighting will be dealt with according to the law, as no one is above the law.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
