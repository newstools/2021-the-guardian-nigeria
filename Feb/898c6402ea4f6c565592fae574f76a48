More than 70,000 candidates, who sat for the October/November 2020 Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE) in Kano State, are yet to get their results due to the alleged failure of the state to pay their registration fees. The National Examinations Council (NECO), last month, released results of 1,209,992 candidates that wrote the examination across the country. According to NECO, 894,101 candidates scored credit in English and Mathematics. Nevertheless, the examination body refused to release the results of more than 70,000 candidates sponsored by Kano State Government, due to failure of the government to remit the candidates’ registration fee. A reliable source at NECO headquarters revealed that the state government was yet to pay the registration fees running into millions of naira. “The examination body has decided to hold on to the results until Kano State Government settles the registration fees. NECO has released result of private candidates, but candidates sponsored by the state government will not be released until payment is made,” the sourced disclosed. Kano Commissioner for Education, Muhammad Kiru, was not disposed to inquiry on the development at the time of filing the report. In August 2020, Kano government approved the release of N489 million for registration of candidates writing NECO and WAEC. In December, it also released N32.4 million for state-sponsored indigent candidates writing SSCE in the state.
