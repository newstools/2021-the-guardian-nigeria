Team Lead of the VoiceOver Academy, Seun Shobo, has advised the government and private sector institutions to invest in helping creative talents learn how to use their voices to earn income. Shobo made the call during a short tour with newsmen on their new facility, which was designed to train voice-over talents and help them discover their voice strengths while also producing top range projects for various individuals and brands. In his remarks, the team lead harped on the need for more investments in the creative industry, which has remained a major contributor to the economy despite the COVID-19 pandemic. “Everything can stop and be locked down, but communication from one entity to another will never stop. This is where voice-over talents come into play,” he said. Head of Internal Operations, Morenike Adams, also said there are partnership opportunities for brands to put unemployed young talents on scholarships at the academy. She urged stakeholders to channel their resources to reducing unemployment and crime by empowering young people with skills like voice-over artistry.
