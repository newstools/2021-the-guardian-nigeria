Elder statesman, Malam Tanko Yakasai has warned against Nigerians arming themselves in self-defence due to the nefarious activities of herders in the country. Yakasai in a chat with The Guardian said such a scenario could lead to the total breakdown of law and order in Nigeria. He enjoined aggrieved Nigerians at the receiving end of the activities of herders to explore laid down rules and regulations to address their grievances. “That will be opening up the door for anarchy and civil war in the country. I am surprised to hear that the call was made by a democratically elected governor of a state. What will then be the justification for the rule of law in society? I do not share such a view. It is against the rule of law and order,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
