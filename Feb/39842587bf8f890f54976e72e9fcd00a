No fewer than 18 persons have been killed by gunmen in separate attacks in Igabi and Chikun councils of Kaduna State. Confirming this yesterday, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the victims of the attack were soft targets. The commissioner, however, stated that several bandits moving in clusters were engaged and naturalised by security operatives in the state. According to Aruwan, Anaba village in Igabi was attacked and seven residents namely Ali Musa, Isa Sharehu, Tijjani Isa, Auwalu Shehu, Hashim Abdullahi, Hassan Saidu and Umar Rilwanu were killed. He also stated that many of the houses in the community were razed, along with storehouses and barns, while about 20 cows were rustled and a number of poultry slaughtered and carted away. Barinje village in Chikun was attacked, with eight persons killed, he said, listing the victims as Sunday Gwamna, Lawal Jizo, Salha Barau, Sabo Barau, Umaru Barau, Muhammadu Azumi, Zailani Dogara and Jikan Gambo. His words: “Some residents were abducted and cattle rustled during the attack. An unspecified number of injured victims are receiving treatment in hospital. “The attacks on these soft targets at Anaba and Barinje followed the killing of several armed bandits by air operations.”  Aruwan explained that air platforms had earlier conducted armed reconnaissance around Anaba. “The crew observed houses on fire and locals migrating to nearby settlements. Some motorbikes were observed with suspicious movements underneath some trees and probing shots were fired at these. Herds of cattle were spotted with bandits in Malul Forest and were engaged accordingly. “Also, air platforms conducted armed reconnaissance over Kawuri, Chikun, Godani, Kusasu, Godani Station, Kwafe, Kuduru, Irina, Chikwale, Kudame, Kwakwau, Beni, Akilbu, Polewire, Rijana, Rugu, Olam farms and adjoining areas.” In another development, bandits have killed one Maryam Tahir at the Ministerial Pilot Housing Estate, Millennium City, Chikun. Governor Nasir el-Rufai reportedly noted the reports with sadness and sent condolences to the families of all those killed in these attacks, while offering prayers for the repose of departed souls. He also wished the injured quick recovery. “The governor commended the crew members for their vigorous response and successful missions, which saw the extermination of many bandits,” Aruwan added.
