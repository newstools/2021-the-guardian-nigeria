An economist, Johnson Chukwu, has called for services of experts in the private sector in the management of the country’s infrastructure projects.
   
He noted that infrastructure development is crucial for Nigeria’s economic growth, particularly as the country seeks economic diversification.
   
According to him, the lack of adequate fiscal revenue to finance infrastructural development has left the economy grossly in deficit in this area.
    
Chukwu pointed out that Nigeria’s debt service has consistently increased from N1 trillion in 2015 to N3.1 trillion as of November 2020, noting that the government is incapable of addressing the country’s infrastructure needs on its own with such a rise.
