A two-day snail and grass cutters farming training has been organised for youths and women in Ibadan North Federal
Constituency. The capacity-building programme, held at the Federal Cooperative College, Eleyele, Ibadan, Oyo State, was organised by the Federal College of Agriculture (FCA), Ibadan and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in conjunction with RAGRA Nig. Limited. Facilitated by the Committee on Agricultural Colleges and Institutions, House of Representatives, Abuja, 50 trainees took part in the programme, which is the second phase, with each of the trainees given N50, 000 to start up their farming business. A former member of the National Assembly from Ekiti State, Ifeoluwa Arowosegbe, a consultant who organised the training, urged women and youths to embrace agriculture, in order to have multiple streams of income. 
 
The former lawmaker, who stressed the need for the acquisition of the right skills for profitable farming, said: “For the youth to be able to do proper farming, they need to be educated properly and have the right skills. What we are doing here is actually adding skills to the youth and women. “We are empowering them to start up and add value to their farming business, which has a tremendous market, particularly in this part of the country. We  have given them the necessary skills in rearing grass cutter and snails in Southwest, particularly in Ibadan North Federal Constituency. “They can now go for bigger loans to start snails and grass cutter farming. There are lots of interventions from the Federal Government, particularly from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, which people can access to start agricultural production.” On her part, the Executive Provost, Federal College of Agriculture (FCA), Ibadan, Dr. (Mrs) Elizabeth Augustus, who sent a delegation to the programme said: “The training has also presented the youth and women opportunity to interact, make friends and connections, which can be of immense benefits to you in the future. “Overall, you have received the potential to become self-sufficient with the possibility of becoming an employer of labour. You can maximise the benefit of the knowledge and skills obtained in this training. If you are employed in agricultural business, you should begin to make use of the knowledge gained to improve your business.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
