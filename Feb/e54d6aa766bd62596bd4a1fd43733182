Soccer Football – Championship – Derby County – Wayne Rooney Press Conference – Pride Park, Derby, Britain – August 6, 2019   Derby County’s Wayne Rooney during the press conference   Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine England and Manchester United’s all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney has urged the Premier League to get rid of the use of VAR as it is ruining the emotion of football for players and fans. Rooney is in his first managerial job with Derby in the Championship, which does not have VAR in place due to financial restrictions. “Watching the Premier League games, some of the decisions are very frustrating through VAR and you don’t understand how they have got to that decision,” said Rooney ahead of the Rams’ trip to Wycombe on Tuesday. “I personally think the game’s better without it. Even though you are frustrated at times after games, we have to rely on the referees to do the job the best they can. “Even though you don’t agree with some decisions, we have to let them do the job and respect their views on it.” Rooney was never shy of voicing his opinion to officials as a player, but believes it is a connection with fans that could be lost due to VAR even when stadiums are opened back up. “It takes the emotion out of the moment,” he added. “I remember some of the goals I scored when I could have been onside or offside. You take a glance over and see the linesman’s flag is down and you carry on with your celebration. “It’s the one time the fans feel connected to their club and their player when they are celebrating a goal together. Take that away and you lose that connection players have with fans.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
