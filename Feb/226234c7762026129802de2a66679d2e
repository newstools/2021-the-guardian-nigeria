President of the Nigerian Muaythai Federation, Paul Egonu, has urged athletes to be focused and remain resilient in their career, saying dedication is the only way of becoming successful in the sport. February 6 every year is celebrated as Muaythai Day with practitioners of the sport around the globe paying homage to King Somdej Phra Sanpher the Eighth, better known as Phra Chao Sua, or the Tiger King. The Tiger King is renowned for his skills in martial arts, rising to the throne on February 6, 1702. Speaking during the celebration of the 2021 Muaythai Day at the weekend, Egonu said the festivity is to remind practitioners of the importance of the sport to human health, adding that the sport goes back a 1000 years when Muaythai was the ancient art of the battlefields, securing the freedom of a proud country, which evolved into a modern Thailand, today regardedÂ as the land of the free. With IOC recognition and the cooperation of IFMA as a member of the Olympics world, the World Muaythai Council under royal patronage from the Royal Thai Government organised a two-day celebration to mark the event.
