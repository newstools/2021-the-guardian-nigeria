 NAFDAC  “Today, we are gathered on this platform as producers of packaged water and we all know that the situation in Nigeria today is such that the entire Nigerian populace (including the healthy, elderly, pregnant women, children and the weak with low immunity) depend on packaged water for sustenance, as many believe falsely or rightly that the municipal water, where available, may hardly be safe for drinking,” she said.
 
Describing water as a unique product because it has no alternative, Adeyeye said everybody needs water or at least water-based product for hydration, proper digestion of food, drugs and other human needs to sustain life. The NAFDAC boss, however, said that water could only sustain life when it is available for drinking in the safe and potable form; otherwise, it could cause health complications and even death.
 
Both national presidents of the Association of Table Water Producers (ATWAP), Mrs Tina Ativie, and Water Producers Association of Nigeria (WAPAN), Mr. Egberi Odiri Mackson, commended NAFDAC for the initiative and expressed the desire of their associations to cooperate and collaborate with NAFDAC to ensure sanity in the packaged water sector.
