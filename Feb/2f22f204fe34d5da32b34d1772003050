 Olori Boye-Ajayi  The BTN journey kicked off between February 8 and 9, 2021, with the virtual Women in Business Salon Series, and high-profiled speakers including, Olori Boye-Ajayi, Barr. Kola Awe, Ms. Shade Bembatoum-Young, Ms. Dorothy Ogbutor and Mr. Babajide Sodipo. They sensitised women from across the world on the trading industry, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) establishment protocols, application of the business models to their businesses, and all-important factors to become a modern day businesswoman as well as upscale their businesses to global levels. Speaking on the initiative, BTN President Boye-Ajayi who is also the author of Borderless Trade: A Step-by-Step guide to exporting your product, said, “Research has shown us that there is only one in four women in the export industry and that is the gap we are trying to bridge. We want women to be at equal competitive levels and we have to help ourselves.” She further stated that BTN is in partnership with the U.S Consulate, Lagos, and Ascend Studios Foundation for the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) programme. “The partnership with the AWE was very paramount due to the fact that it is a White House initiative. The target is to empower 50 million women by 2025, both financially and economically.” Boye-Ajayi also mentioned the similarities with the partners and how they share a common goal to empower women, adding that the programme will run for a period of six months with thoughtfully organised activities that will impact every woman in business or transition, inside the BTN. Commenting on other projects, she mentioned the Zero to Hero initiative in partnership with Zenith bank, which is a transformative training to drastically improve lives of women in the Export Community Agency (ECA).
