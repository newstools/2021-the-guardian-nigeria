Brandy Announces Her Version Of ‘Cinderella’ Will Soon Be On Disney+ Brandy has announced that Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella, the 1997 TV movie event that she starred in, is coming to the Disney+ streaming service on February 12th. The singer made the announcement on Thursday’s episode of The View, telling the hosts, including her Cinderella co-star Whoopi Goldberg, that “we can celebrate and share and inspire a whole new generation to see this wonderful piece.” According to Rollingstone, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella helped relaunch The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC when it first aired in 1997; it featured a groundbreaking multicultural cast that was unique to the adaptation. In addition to Brandy and Goldberg, it also starred Bernadette Peters, Victor Garber, Jason Alexander, Veanne Cox, and Paolo Montalban, as well as the late Whitney Houston and Natalie Desselle-Reid. Houston personally handpicked Brandy to be cast as Cinderella while she also played the Fairy Godmother and acted as executive producer on the film. The made-for-TV movie was written by Robert L. Freedman, directed by Robert Iscove, and choreographed by Rob Marshall, who went on to direct the film versions of Chicago and Into the Woods, as well as the upcoming live-action The Little Mermaid. In celebration of Black History Month, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella will join the “Celebrate Black Stories” collection on Disney+, which also includes Soul, Black Is King and Black Panther.
