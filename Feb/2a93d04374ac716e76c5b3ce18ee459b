Maraj was walking on a road in Mineola at about 6pm Friday when he was struck by a car heading northbound on Roslyn Road at the intersection with Raff Avenue, authorities said. The driver fled the scene and has yet to be identified. Investigators have asked for the public’s help in tracking them down. Maraj was rushed to a hospital, where he allegedly died. Minaj, 38, has yet to comment publicly on her father’s death. The tragic news comes four months after the Super Bass rapper welcomed her first child with husband Kenneth Petty. The family has already had a tough year, after Minaj’s brother Jelani Maraj was sentenced to life in prison in January 2020 for raping an 11-year-old child. Minaj has spoken about her relationship with her father on multiple occasions, often posting photos of the pair sharing loving embraces on social media. Robert Maraj was of mixed Afro- and Indo-Trinidadian ancestry. He was from Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago. When Minaj was a little girl living with her grandmother in Saint James, Robert and his wife, Carol Maraj, were living in America, looking for work and a house in Queens, New York City. After finding a home, Minaj moved to Queens with her parents at the age of five.
