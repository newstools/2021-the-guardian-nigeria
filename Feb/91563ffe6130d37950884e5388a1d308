Born Ayorinde Kehinde Okiki, DJ Kaywise holds a special place in the hearts of music artistes in Nigeria for his contribution to the promotion of fresh sounds, which have often morphed into smash hits. Whether as a disc jockey or video jockey, DJ Kaywise has an incredible ear for good music. This, combined with his knack for flipping the beats and shuffling the tracks, has made him one of the most sought after contemporary DJs in urban music. DJ Kaywise’s music portfolio has made him a trendsetter in music culture. Afrobeats is what it is today because of the creativity that the likes of DJ Kaywise have poured into making the said music genre one of the most marketable and export-ready music in the world. Just recently, he was unveiled as the Goldberg Brand Ambassador, a rare feat amongst the men of the “wheels of steel.” In the music history, disc jockeys are categorised as “behind-the-scenes” professionals who make the frontmen popular. But the hip-hop game of the 90s changed the dynamics for disc jockeys. The DJs became recognisable faces and top influencers in pop culture. Grandmaster Flash, Jam Master Jay, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Clue and Dr Dre were among the fire-brands that shattered the glass ceilings in the music industry. And in recent years, many would agree that DJ Khaled has revolutionised the way disc jockeys are positioned and perceived in pop culture with his unparalleled impact outside his studio work on social media platforms like Snapchat and Tik Tok. To bring the beat back home in Nigeria, DJ Kaywise, who boasts of over 3000 mixtapes, belongs to the new crop of DJs who are rewriting the narrative of music from Africa. His art is beyond entertaining just a few but curating a culture around music. For instance, his Joor Concert series had attracted over 25,000 music fans on Lagos Mainland. Artists such as Davido, Tekno, Lil Kesh, Olamide, Ninola, Reminisce, Wale Turner, Terry G, Oritsefemi, CDQ, Pepenazi had been headliners at this high-octane concert. The concert is one of the most-streamed concerts in Nigeria and has fast become a cultural staple among music enthusiasts. The rise of DJ Kaywise as an ambassador for Goldberg continues the brand’s journey to not only appeal to people who celebrate tradition and culture, but also young Nigerians who have transcended the times and have struck a balance between a long-held culture and more modern norms. Kaywise is a natural at exuding this trait, whilst remaining authentic and true to his roots. The talented artist who kicked off his career professionally in 2010 had gradually climbed through the rungs of the music ladder to work with top acts like Olamide, Naira Marley, Tiwa Savage, Zlatan Ibile and Niniola. Using his unique style of music production, Kaywise projects African and Nigerian cultures and values through Afrobeats to the rest of the world, a quality that is synonymous with the Goldberg brand. Hence, the brand’s choice to unveil the renowned DJ as its ambassador is just perfect. In his reaction to the announcement of his new Goldberg image, DJ Kaywise expressed his gratitude saying:
“I started out in the industry in 2010, putting in my blood and sweat to ensure I produce sounds that people around me and those in the diaspora could identify and connect with. There are a couple of acts out here in the industry and Goldberg reaching out to me shows that all of my hard work hasn’t gone unnoticed. In my new role as an ambassador, I hope to continuously project both myself and the brand in a manner that connects well with my fans and Goldberg lovers, working to keep our culture and values fresh in their minds.” DJ Kaywise joins artiste, Olamide and actor, Odunlade Adekola, on Goldberg’s portfolio as the brand envisions an exciting 2021 for its consumers. Speaking on the announcement, the Portfolio Manager, Mainstream Brands, Nigerian Breweries Plc., Omotunde Adenusi said: “DJ Kaywise is a household name on the Nigerian music scene and we’re excited to have him on the brand” Omotunde said. “Kaywise, just like Goldberg, brings his fans closer to their roots, through his music, yet keeping them in touch with the trends. This perfect blend of both worlds is what the Goldberg brand has become known for.” Over the years, Goldberg has consistently pushed the bar in beer craft and excellence. The beer brand has continually provided fans and consumers with remarkable enjoyable experiences that refresh culture and traditions, whilst appreciating the modern trends. Backed by high power artists who embody culture and tradition, Goldberg no doubt possesses that unique identity that connects consumers to their roots, making it one of the most authentic consumer brands in the country.
