 WASHINGTON, DC – FEBRUARY 01: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki talks to reporters during her daily news briefing at the White House February 01, 2021 in Washington, DC. Psaki commented on President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Senate Republicans, the government’s response to the military coup in Burma and coronavirus relief legislation, among other topics.

But Myanmar’s once iconic democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi drew Western criticism over her reticence to condemn mass killings of Rohingya Muslims. On Monday, the military arrested her and other politicians after her party scored another sweeping election victory. “The United States is taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour,” Biden said, in what was likely a veiled reference to China “We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
