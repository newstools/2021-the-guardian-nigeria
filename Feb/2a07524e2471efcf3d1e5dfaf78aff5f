Rising Afro Pop singer, Dike Bright Nnamdi, also known as DK Regan, has revealed his dream to consolidate on his music career with a possible collaboration with two of Nigeria’s music giants, Wizkid and Burna Boy. This follows on the success of the D’Grand Records artiste’s latest song entitled Big Chief produced by Jaysynths, the wave-making producer critical to the success of hits by Teni such as Case and Uyo Meyo. DK Regan’s single also got a big boost with the release of a crisp music video shot abroad and directed by Mose Visual. Speaking on his possible career moves, the artiste who hails from Nwangele, Imo State reveals, “I love MI Abaga, Wizkid, Tekno, Davido, Drake and Lil Wayne with due respect to names of other artistes who are not mentioned by me. All these artistes bring life into their music and their passion for what they do is exceptional. I will like to collaborate with Burna Boy, Wizkid and other top artist in the music industry. The reason is because they will help bring out the best in me there by igniting my passion.” “I see my music and brand as one of the biggest in the future because of what I know I carry and ready to deliver. My goal is to use my music to reach out to the society, send positive messages and help calm the trouble hearted,” he explains. The Afro Pop artiste was born on July 31, 1994, the talented artiste was born in a family six and raised in the city of Benin, Edo State. “I used to sing in the choir back then. Back then in those days, I use to have a friend whom together we travel to a few local areas in Edo State to do some performance. I have been singing from a very young age and I believe that the time has come for me to bring my artistry to fruition. I believe the time is now to make a mark and a stand. He explains, “I am someone that is very persistent and consistent because I believe in the famous saying by Napoleon Hill: ‘what the mind of man can conceive, the hand of man can achieve.’ I’m a very disciplined and humble young man with great respect for my predecessors. This is one thing that has been keeping me going. I believe this positive attitude will one day take me to great heights in my career and aspirations.”
