Officials of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has intercepted two fake military officers Mohammed Nura and Abubakar Dahiru with 234 kilogramme cannabis. The duo were intercepted along Okene-Lokoja expressway on Monday by the officers of the agency’s Kogi state Command. NDLEA Kogi state commander Adewunmi Alfred said the Nura and Dahiru when questioned by the NDLEA officers identified themselves as military officers but his men insisted they search their vehicle a VIP edition Hilux Jeep. He said it was during the search the officers found 394 compressed blocks of cannabis sativa in different compartments of the vehicle. “Our initial investigations have revealed that the consignment was taken from Lagos and heading to Kano for delivery.” Alfred said. “Though the two men identified themselves as military officers but that did not sway our men from a thorough search of their vehicle and the result was the discovery of the illicit drugs tucked in every hidden part of the vehicle.” “Indeed, we suspect the two men to be fake military officers until proven otherwise.” Alfred also stated that the vehicle has been impounded, the illicit drugs seized and the suspects detained for further investigations. “Investigations have commenced and the outcome would be forwarded for further directives and appropriate action,” Alfred said.
