The National President of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Iju Nwabunike, has warned that continuous corruption and insecurity in the Nigerian port system and maritime environment may mar the implementation of the Nigeria Port Process Manual (NPPM).
  
Nwabunike, in an open letter, addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, lamented that narrow-minded interests and corruption, which is allowed to reign in the country’s maritime environment for long, would serve as obstacles to actualising the mandate of the NPPM, which seeks to ensure port efficiency and effectiveness.
  
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has begun the implementation of the NPPM, which was launched by Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, late last year to improve Nigeria’s ranking on the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), while sanitising the port system. The Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) has been appointed as the implementation lead agency.  “The causes of maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea are multiple and multilayered, and they manifest in form violence, corruption, and in communities that resort to any means available to improve their circumstances – even if through illegal trade, insurgency, or piracy,” he said. The ANLCA boss said if the NPPM must be seen as a document of high value beyond a mere paper, its initiators and drivers must shun egoistic tendencies and politicking.
