Professional golfers from four African countries will next month converge on Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital for the first Bayelsa State Governor’s Cup International Golf Tournament. The event, which will be organised by the HSD Golf and Country Club, will hold from March 4 to 7. According to the Captain of the HSD Golf and Country Club, Mr. Oyintonefie Richie Etonye, the international tournament is specially organised to mark the one year anniversary in the office of Governor Douye Diri. Etonye, who is also the Permanent Secretary, Government House, Yenagoa, said a mini-golf lounge, and an open-air relaxation sports bar built in honour of the Governor, will also be officially commissioned. He said the HSD Golf and Country Club is proud of the modest but significant achievements of Governor Diri in the last one year, which has made the state to experience peace and stability. Recounting the political tension that heralded the governor’s ascension, Etonye noted that with pragmatic leadership, Diri was able to douse the tension, mobilised the state together and began a process of healing and fence-mending in Nembe and other hitherto troubled areas in the state. The HSD Golf and Country Club Captain hinted that the golf tournament would be played with all COVID-19 protocols, and the participating professional golfers from the four African countries of Zimbabwe, Ghana, Gabon, and Cameroun have all been fully informed and are equally ready to adhere strictly to it.
