An FCT High Court, Zuba on Monday, fixed March 22 for the arraignment of Olawunmi Audu and Access Bank in a case of alleged unlawful deduction of N197.2 million from Chimex Aluminium and Steel Company. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) filed 21 counts bordering on abettment against Audu and Access Bank Plc. Justice A.O. Ebong fixed the date after the EFCC counsel, Halidu Mohammed, informed the court that the matter cannot proceed because the charge against the defendants were still being reviewed. He however craved the court’s indulgence to put his house in order and asked for a date for arraignment. Olawunmi Audu and her counsel, Aliyu Hussain were in court but Access Bank was not represented. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suspects was stalled on Jan.12, after the defence counsel, Aliyu Hussain said Audu was pregnant and had to be at the hospital for her medical examination. The prosecution counsel however told the court that the charges against the suspects were under review on the said date. The EFCC asserted that Audu aided Uche Sado, also a staff of Access Bank and relationship officer of De Chimex Aluminium and  Steel Company Ltd to transfer N197.2 million from the possession of Chimex Company. The prosecution said Audu allegedly abetted the use as genuine a forged document titled ” Access Bank Fund transfer/standing order form” sometime in May, 2018, adding that the offence contravened Sections 85, 287 and 364 of the Penal Code.
