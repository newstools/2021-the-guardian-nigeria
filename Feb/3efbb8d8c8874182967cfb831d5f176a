Former Super Eagles gangling striker, Victor Okechukwu Agali, says he is satisfied with the conduct of players and coaches at the ongoing Victor Agali/AS Racine U-17 Football Scouting tournament in Ughelli, Delta State. Agali grew up the hard way in the then rustic village of Okpanam, on the outskirts of Asaba, but used football to free himself from the stranglehold of the hard-knock life that millions of Nigerians are used to. He said that he had selected some players from the ongoing U-17 grassroots football programme for clubs in Ughelli, who will join him for another programme to heighten their career, as the train moves to Lagos State soon. The Victor Agali/AS Racine U-17 Football Scouting tournament in Ughelli, powered by ace football administrator, Emma Ibru, entered its semifinal yesterday. FC Planners of Ughelli eliminated Kingdom Stars FC of Bayelsa State by 2-1. The Ughelli team will face Golden Friends FC, who also recorded a 2-1 win against Maro11 Speedsters. Excellent FC qualified with a 5-3 penalty shootout after playing 1-1 against Agbara U-17 team in regulation time. The victory gave them the ticket to confront Great Avengers FC, who defeated AS Racine 2-1 at Ibru College, Agbara.
