The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to seek help from Israel, United States and other countries to sustain the fight against insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other crimes in the country. Speaking at the inauguration of Belusochukwu Enwere as the new national chairman of its Youth Wing (YOWICAN), yesterday in Abuja, CAN President, Rev Dr. Samson Ayokunle noted that the association is seriously worried about the deteriorating security situation in the country, adding that the present administration seems to be overwhelmed by the problem. Ayokunle, represented by the Assistant General Secretary of CAN, Apostle Biodun Sanyaolu, observed that government’s primary responsibility is to protect lives and property. He said: “It is very obvious that Nigeria needs assistance. I’m not President Muhammadu Buhari, but I’m sure that he will also be worried. He should be willing to seek help from anywhere, as insecurity has reached a worrying point, where nobody is safe. We need help. Let me use the opportunity to tell the President to reach out to Israel, United States and other countries that could be of help to Nigeria… “We are seriously worried in CAN because we are affected by the security challenges in Nigeria. Insecurity, banditry and kidnapping are threats to human race… We will continue to pray for government because there is lack of security everywhere, from Adamawa to Lagos, Sokoto to Enugu. The highways are not safe.
Even when you’re in your house, you’re not safe…” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
