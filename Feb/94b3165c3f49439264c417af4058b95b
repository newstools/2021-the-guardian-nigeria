Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) President, Daniel Igali, has revealed that athletes will start camping in preparation for both the African/Oceania qualifier and Africa Championships from March 5 to March 29. Rivalries are expected to hold in the men’s freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling and women’s freestyle wrestling. Igali, who said Team Nigeria’s first batch will depart for Morocco on March 30, added that the Olympic qualifiers will hold between April 2 and 4, while the African Championships will hold from April 6 to 11, 2021 in El Jadida, Morocco. The NWF boss said both the Olympic qualifiers and the African championships would hold at the same venue to avoid the hiccups that may arise from the COVID-19 protocols. “The 2021 Oceania/ Africa Olympics qualifier is the first event that will be held between April 2 and 4. Two days later, the Africa Championships will now take the centre stage from April 6 to 11 both in El Jadida. “The events will be held at the same venue so that countries coming for the Olympics qualifiers and the African championships do not have to go to another country to again observe the COVID-19 rules and all of that,” he said, adding that the federation plans to ensure the country maintains her status at the African championships. “The wrestlers going for the Olympics qualifiers will travel first with the referee on March 30. And then the rest athletes, including myself, will travel on March 31. About five girls will join the Olympics qualifying team as you know, all weight classes are not Olympics classes,” he stated.
