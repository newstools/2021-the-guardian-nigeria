Chrissy Teigen Reacts To Being Unfollowed By Biden On Twitter After being famously blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter since 2017, Chrissy Teigen took to Twitter to demand to be followed by Joe Biden after his victory in the last election. Just a month after asking the new US president to follow her on the social media platform (he obliged), the model and author has requested that he now unfollow her. It seems Chrissy felt like she couldn’t be her true self as one of the few people that Joe Biden’s @POTUS account followed. On Tuesday she made a cheeky request to the commander-in-chief, tweeting: I have tweeted a handful of times since my treasured @POTUS following. In order for me to flourish as me, I must ask you to please lord unfollow me. I love you!!! It’s not you it’s me!!!! Shortly after the request, the POTUS account apparently obliged and stopped following her. She dropped some tweets to show her happiness. She tweeted: bitch fuck shit suck the d I am FREE!!!!!!!!!!!! — chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 23, 2021  Chrissy also shared screenshots of the POTUS Twitter account, showing that the number of those followed by Joe Biden’s official account dropped from 13 to 12. Chrissy’s Twitter relationship with Biden’s started on 20 January when she posted a simple “hello @joebiden I have been blocked by the president for four years can I get a follow plz.” He followed her after the request and most of her fans were happy Joe did follow her. She was blocked by then-president Donald Trump after trolling him and finally tweeting, “Lolllllll no one likes you” in July 2017.
