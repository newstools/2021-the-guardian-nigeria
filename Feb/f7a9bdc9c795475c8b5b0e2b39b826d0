 Adekunle Gold  The virtual concert, which held on Instagram, rewarded five winners from the #UnityBankJingleChallenge including the duo of Oyatoki Omolola and Olaoluwa Bayonle Emmanuel who delivered the jingle in a sign language – becoming the first to ever do so. His participation is a good pointer to inclusivity and Nigeria’s unity that the Bank represents. The other four winners were all upcoming artistes who used the opportunity to promote their talents and interacted with Adekunle Gold. Twenty-four other winners also smiled home with cash prizes in a trivia question session. The concert was a bold statement on the Bank’s advocacy for increased investment in the creative sector. According to the bank’s Head of Corporate Communications, DeVoe Okorie, “At Unity Bank, our resolve is to continue to create initiatives that will enable us to always reinforce Nigeria’s unity. This virtual concert, therefore, reaffirms that resolve and commitment. Also, at a time that the global pandemic has disrupted normal life, we feel that an activity like this can help to lift spirits and spread joy in the midst of uncertainties.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
