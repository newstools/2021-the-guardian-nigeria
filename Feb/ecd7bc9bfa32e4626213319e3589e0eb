An aspirant in this year’s Anambra State governorship election under the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. George Moghalu, has called on party members and intending members to troop out in large numbers to participate in the membership drive. Moghalu, a former national auditor of the party and the Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority, urged existing members to revalidate their membership and new members to register their names in the party’s register. The exercise, which kicks off across the state today in all the polling units after series of hiccups, is expected to last two weeks. Moghalu appealed to all participants to conduct themselves diligently and in accordance with the prevailing COVID-19 protocols, saying the re-validation exercise would take place simultaneously in all the council of the state. He said it is very important to the APC-led Federal Government, as it would assist it monitor socio-economic activities, including size of palliatives to be deployed whenever the need arises and also enable them monitor rigging in elections. He charged existing and intending members to visit their respective polling units with passport photographs and their voter’s cards and those who have attained the voting age of 18 years to register as members, saying massive registration would put the state and Southeast on a very good stead in the bid for the presidency at the appropriate time.
