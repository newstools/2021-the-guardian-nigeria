 Participants at the workshop organised by the Association of Organic Agriculture Practitioners of Nigeria (NOAN) in Ibadan, Oyo State.  “So, the more we are able to transit to the environmental friendly system, crop production and agriculture, the better for us. So, this particular system would gradually transit to environmentally friendly practice for organic agriculture. 
 
“Organic agriculture came to Africa through the decision of the African Union (AU) President. They decided that organic agriculture is the main thing in Africa, because most of the environments in Africa are very sensitive. Africa is dominated by sub-Sahara areas where the soil is weak, the environment is very sensitive and it has been affected with climate change.  
 
“The major solution is organic agriculture. Mainly, organic agriculture is practicing agriculture in a very friendly and conducive way without using extraneous materials that will make the environment deteriorate.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
