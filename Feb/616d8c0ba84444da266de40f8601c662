The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Friday Eboka, has dissolved the Eagle Crack Squad of the state Command over unprofessional conduct. A statement signed by the Command’s spokesman, Mr. Nnamdi Omoni, said the decision was taken after a meeting with the management team, noting that the dissolution followed complaints of unprofessional conduct exhibited by the personnel of the unit. The Guardian gathered that some officers of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) infiltrated the unit, leading to upsurge in extortion and human rights abuses by the unit. Findings showed that the unit took possession of the former SARS building located at Rupokwu in Obio/Akpor Council, an arrangement that made it easy for the ex-SARS officers to find their way into the unit. There have been several reports of harassments, extortions, intimidation and brutality of innocent citizens by the unit since September last year. The Police spokesman said the dissolution was with immediate effect, adding that all personnel attached to the unit are to report to the headquarters for redeployment. The state Police chief had, in his maiden press briefing on Tuesday, February 23, promised to address all cases of infractions by Police personnel and increase supervision of the men, with a stern warning to deal with erring officers and hold DPOs/HODs liable. Part of the statement read: “The public is hereby enjoined to rekindle their trust in the Police, as the Command is committed to giving them improved policing services that will stand the test of time.” Meanwhile, residents have expressed delight over the swift action by the new Police chief, saying the move would serve as deterrent to other police tactical units.
