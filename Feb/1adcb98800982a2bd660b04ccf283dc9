According to the Nigerian singer-songwriter, “Bad Dancer”, which is the first lead from his forthcoming debut album is “the most beautiful love song you will hear this year.” Announcing the release of the new song, Johnny Drille said: “This one makes even me feel loved and I’m happy to share this piece of me with you. “‘Bad Dancer’ is one of my most beautiful and emotional love songs, makes even I feel so loved and it is my hope that it makes you feel that way too.” In the new song, Drille admits to his lover that he is terrible at dancing but he would love to take her “slow dancing into the starry night” and hold her tightly while he whispers into her ear. And perhaps it is not just a song as the singer admits on social media that he is indeed terrible at dancing: I gave up trying to dance well, from now on I’ll just dance what I know. So here’s my take on some popular dance moves. If you can’t dance, you can’t, so just do you  #BadDancer pic.twitter.com/5heN1cKveX — Johnny Drille #BadDancer (@Johnnydrille) February 19, 2021  Listen to “Bad Dancer” below:  On February 4, 2020, the Mavins recording artiste announced that he had finished recording the last song on the forthcoming album: “Today, at exactly 3:24PM I finished recording the last song on my album. 5 years of labor of love, and here we are.
