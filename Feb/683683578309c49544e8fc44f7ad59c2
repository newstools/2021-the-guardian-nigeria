 Thomas  While reacting at the interactive session on Safer Internet Dialog On Hate Speeches,  Executive Director (ED), NFVCB, Adedayo Thomas, said, “when a child is being brought up, there are things we ask the child not to say; so, the issue of hate speech is part and parcel of our moral development on a daily basis.
“Part of our media literacy programmes is to enlighten the people and when it concern NFVCB, it’s because of the kind of things we see on a daily basis as it affects the society. In our work, we should be wary of what we project especially as it concern the creative industry so that we are not being seen as contributing to negativity in the society. So, we need to address ourselves about that.” Speaking on the challenges in the industry and double taxation, he said, “we must reduce taxation to a maximum of five per cent because at the end of the day, with NIN combined with BVN, we are getting to a point where we will have to pay 7.5 per cent VAT and nobody will be able to escape tax; but by then that will give us the confidence to demand for what we were supposed to demand for.” Addressing the issue of some practitioners not belonging to the pool, he said, “it is an insult for some to call themselves independent movie producers since there is no independent lawyer, independent engineer, or surveyor or other profession not having an   association. If anyone doessn’t want to be involved in our politics he or she should pay his due, if anyone does not want to pay his due, he can’t be a producer, director or distributor, he should become an executive producer. Whatever is not in the law should not be accommodated.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
