A federal high court sitting in Abuja on Wednesday ordered Nigeriaâ€™s apex bank to unfreeze the bank accounts of 20 #EndSARS protesters. The judge, Ahmed Mohammed, gave the order after counsel to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the legal representative of the protesters agreed to end the case. Mohammed sets aside the order it made on November 4, 2020, freezing accounts linked with some promoters of the #EndSARS protests. The CBN froze the bank accounts in the heat of the #EndSARS campaign. Many of those affected were prominent during the protests, which attracted global attention as thousands of people campaigned for an end to police brutality in major Nigerian cities. The demonstrations came to a head-on on October 20 when security forces opened fire at unarmed protesters in Lagos at the Lekki toll gate.
