When he was arrested over the issue, he said the document was issued to him by Isiagu Community Union as Igwe-elect of the community. He also forged many signatures, which he said, were those of members of the town union executive. “But when the leadership of the Isiagu Community Union was invited by the police, they said that the letter did not emanate from them.
