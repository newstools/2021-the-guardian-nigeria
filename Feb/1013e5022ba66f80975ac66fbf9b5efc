Woman Who Sprayed Hair With Gorilla Glue To Donate £14,000 To Charity Tessica Brown, the woman who used Gorilla Glue on her hair is donating £14,000 ($20,000) to charity after a doctor removed the adhesive from her hair for free. She used the glue when she ran out of hairspray one morning and quickly went viral when it would not wash out. In a bid to remove the glue, Tessica hacked off her ponytail, and baffled medics in Louisiana USA used solvent acetone on her head which made the Gorilla Glue sticky again and burnt the influencer’s scalp. After going viral on TikTok, Tessica set up a GoFundMe page that was overwhelmed with donations for the wigs she was expecting to wear. The mum-of-five now plans to donate the money to charity after Los Angles-based Dr. Michael Obeng offered to remove the Gorilla Glue without charge in a four-hour procedure. After raising more than £16,000 ($23,000)in donations, Tessica’s manager told TMZ the influencer will give £14,000 ($20,000) to the Restore Foundation, a charity which is the brainchild of Dr. Obeng and helps those needing reconstructive surgery. The rest of the cash will cover Tessica’s first emergency room visit and flights to LA for treatment. Using a mix of chemicals and natural products Dr. Obeng, who reached out to Tessica after seeing her plight online, dissolved the glue. He practiced different formulas on a dummy head to make sure it would work. In an Instagram post on Saturday, Tessica expressed her thanks, she wrote: “Words cannot even explain how I feel about @drmichaelkobeng you really gave me my life back and I am forever grateful.”   A post shared by Tessica (@im_d_ollady)  Gorilla Glue is more commonly used on products including wood, paper, laminate, fabric, and cardboard. The firm previously said it is was “very sorry” to hear about the “unique” and “unfortunate” situation.
