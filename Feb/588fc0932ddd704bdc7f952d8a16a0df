Financial analysts have listed policy inconsistency and capital control measures as impediments to capital importation and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow into Nigeria.
 
Analysing Nigerian investment climate in its 2020 full-year report, Codros Securities Limited said amidst the global search for high yields in emerging and frontier markets and given ultra-low yields in advanced economies, capital importation into Nigeria has continued on a downward trend, dropping to its lowest level since the first quarter (Q1), 2017.  “True to our prognosis, capital importation dipped in 2020FY dipped by 56.7 PER CENT to USD9.68 billion (2019FY: USD23.99 billion) according to the data released by the NBS last week. “To underscore the scale of things, we note that the aggregate of capital importation from Q2-20 to Q4-20 (USD3.83 billion) was 34.6 per cent less than the total capital inflows to the country in Q1-20 (USD5.85 billion) right before the pandemic ravaged the global economy.”
 
According to the data released by the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) at the weekend, capital importation dipped by 56.7 per cent in 2020 full year to $9.68 billion from $23.99 billion achieved in the corresponding period in 2019, and 42.4 per cent reduction compared to $16.81 billion recorded in 2018.
