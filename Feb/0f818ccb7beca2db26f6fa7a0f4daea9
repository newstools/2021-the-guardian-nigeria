 [FILES] Kano sate Governor, Ganduje. Photo: TWITTER/SADEQHENRY  Kano State Government has barred the leader of Qaddiryya Islamic Sect, Sheikh Abduljabar Nasir-Kabara, from preaching. He was accused of inciting violence with his sermons. The government also restricted the broadcast of Nasir-Kabara’s seminars on radio, television and other media platforms in the state. While addressing journalists, the Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, said the decision was part of the State Executive Council’s resolutions at its weekly meeting held at the Africa House, Government House. The commissioner revealed that security agencies had been directed to ensure full compliance and take decisive action against any person or group found flouting government’s order. Reacting to his sanction however, the cleric has insisted that government action against him was political vendetta. Speaking with journalists yesterday, the Islamic cleric revealed that he was paying the price for his refusal to support Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s re-election in 2019. He alleged that Ganduje, who had made several attempts to prosecute him, finally took advantage of circumstances to inflict what he considered injustice on him. “The reasons are very obvious. The person who took the decision had said it times without number that he never forgives. I fought him during the last election and he promised to revenge. Only that he is taking the wrong decision at the wrong time. “So, this ban is purely political; it has nothing to do with religion or incitement. I have told my followers to prepare their votes ahead of the next election and do the needful. I am fighting scholars, not government; but at the end, the government took over the fight,” he said. The cleric appealed to his followers to exercise restraint and resist any temptation to revolt.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
