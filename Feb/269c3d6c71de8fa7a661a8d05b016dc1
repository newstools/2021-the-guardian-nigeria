Amaju Pinnick Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick, says he is ‘grateful and humbled’ by Federal Government’s endorsement of his campaign for a seat in FIFA Council at the forthcoming 43rd Ordinary General Assembly of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Rabat, Morocco. The FIFA Council election is scheduled for March 12. The Presidency’s letter of endorsement, signed by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, said the Federal Government and Nigerians are delighted for the unique opportunity to have another Nigerian occupy a seat in the FIFA Council after Oyo Orok Oyo and Dr. Amos Adamu. Dare stated on Tuesday in Abuja when the NFF boss paid him a courtesy visit that President Muhammadu Buhari and all Nigerians will support Pinnick in his campaign to clinch a seat in the FIFA council election. He said the Federal Government will support Pinnick to fly Nigeria and Africa’s flag at the highest FIFA decision-making council, adding, however, that Pinnick needs to use his position and connections in CAF and FIFA to help promote and develop Nigerian and African football at all levels. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Pinnick described the endorsement by President Buhari as wonderful and encouraging, adding, “I feel very grateful and humbled.” Pinnick thanked the Sports Minister for his ‘brotherly love and support,’ just as he pledged to be a good ambassador of Nigeria if elected into the FIFA Council. The 37-member FIFA Council is the main decision-making body of the world football body that sets FIFA and global football vision. Only two Nigerians, Oyo Orok and Amos Adamu have risen to FIFA Council members’ position in the past.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
