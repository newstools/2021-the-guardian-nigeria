The association of staff of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) has called on its members across the nation, who are yet to register with the body to do so without delay. The General Secretary of the association, Mr. â€˜Yinka Adeyemo, made the call on behalf of the President, Mr. Stanley Ilumah, during a familiarisation visit by the leadership of the association to states in the Southwest of the country. The General Secretary, who led the delegation, stressed the commitment of the leadership towards ensuring that the aims and objectives of the association, part of which include good representation to the Federal Government, their former employer, to ensure that payment of their outstanding entitlements, among others, are realized. Adeyemo assured that all members would be issued an identification card upon confirmation that they have satisfied all the requirements to become bona fide members. The Association came into existence as a response to the plight of the over 50,000 disengaged staff of the defunct PHCN who are dying daily as a result of non-payment of their entitlements, seven years after they were laid off.
