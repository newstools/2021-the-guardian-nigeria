The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) filed a one count charges against Henry over false pretence with intent to defraud Mosley. The charge read: “That you Oluwatoyin Henry sometimes in 2019, at Ogbomosho, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, with intent to defraud, obtained the sum of One Thousand Two Hundred United States of America Dollars (USD$1,200) from one Betty Mosley, when you falsely represented to him that you are a citizen of United States of America by name Amanda, who is in love with him which representations you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence.” Henry pleaded guilty to the amended charge after a plea bargain agreement with the prosecution. Based on his plea, he was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison. He was also ordered to restitute the sum of $1,200 USD to his victim, and forfeit his iPhone 11, one Infinix Hot 5 and a Nokia phone to the Federal Government of Nigeria.
