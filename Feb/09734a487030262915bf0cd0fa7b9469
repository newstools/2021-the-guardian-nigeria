The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the United States and other members of the international community to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to take decisive steps to protect Nigerians and curb escalated violence, terrorism and banditry ravaging Nigeria under his watch. PDP also urged President Buhari to respond to widespread cry for credible elections in the country by making personal commitment towards accelerated amendment to the Electoral Act, to, among other things, give statutory force to simultaneous electronic transmission of results and use of card readers in elections. The party’s National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, presented the position of the party at a crucial meeting with the Political Officer with the United States Embassy in Nigeria, Mr. Jerry Howard, at the PDP national secretariat, Abuja yesterday. Secondus lamented the horrible level of insecurity, increased terrorism, wanton killings and kidnapping in the country and alleged that Buhari administration failed to demonstrate capacity to protect the citizens. He said: “This is the reason PDP, as a party that has the interest of Nigeria at heart, is putting together a non-partisan national conference on security. “Everyday, our nation is confronted with reports of gruesome killings, kidnapping and unrestrained destruction across our country. As a party and patriotic citizens, we can no longer continue to watch. That is why we are putting together a non-partisan conference on security.” Secondus predicted food crisis in the country if the security situation, which has crippled agricultural and economic activities, is not addressed. On electoral reforms, PDP expressed worry that Nigerians have lost interest in the electoral system “due to the manipulations being witnessed under the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.” The party urged Buhari to leave a legacy of credible elections by ensuring accelerated amendment to the Electoral Act.
