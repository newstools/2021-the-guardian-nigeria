Analysts said the gradual release of corporate earnings spurred buying interests in dividend-paying stocks, which was further strengthened by the outcome of the MPC meeting. The Chief Research Officer at Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omordion, said: “The market finally broke out of the 42,000 psychological line, helped by the influx of unaudited corporate earnings offering an insight into what investors should expect from the 2020 December year-end audited earnings reports. “This is in the midst of positive sentiments that have been helped by the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates unchanged, following which funds continue to enter the market, as indicated by money flow index and sentiment report. “Consequently, we advise that players should take advantage of breakouts to position in dividend-paying stocks, with numbers likely to beat expectations, given that the factors driving the rally remain intact. We note too that trading patterns are supporting mispriced stocks and high yield dividend-paying companies. However, let us not forget that profit taking and price correction are integral parts of stock market investing or trading.” Analysts at Codros Capital also said: “With the outcome of the MPC meeting aligning with market expectations amid negative real returns in the fixed income market, we expect risk-averse investors to recalibrate their portfolio towards fundamentally sound stocks with attractive dividend yields. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally-justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” A breakdown of the market performance last week showed that transactions on the equity sector of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) reopened upbeat on Monday, occasioned by bargain-hunting in some high capital stocks. The market capitalisation appreciated by N45 billion and the All-Share Index (ASI) grew by 86.97 absolute points or 0.21 per cent increase to close at 41,088.96 points. Also, the overall market capitalisation gained N45 billion to close at N21.494 trillion. The market gain was driven by price appreciation in large and medium value stocks including Airtel Africa, Dangote Cement, MRS Oil Nigeria, Julius Berger, and Lafarge Africa. Transactions on the NSE sustained a rising profile on Tuesday, causing market capitalisation to rise further by N260 billion. Consequently, the ASI appreciated by 495.98 absolute points, or 1.21 per cent increase to close at 41,584.94 points. Also, the overall market capitalisation gained N260 billion to close at N21.754 trillion. The uptrend was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capital stocks, including Airtel Africa, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, MTN Nigeria Communications, and Fidson Healthcare. Trading on the bourse sustained the rally for the third consecutive day, as more blue-chip stocks joined the league of gainers, causing investors wealth to soar by N440 billion in three trading days.

The ASI grew by 841.77 points, a 2.0 per cent increase from 41,088.96 to 41,930.73. Wednesday’s upturn was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capital stocks including, Airtel Africa, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Lafarge Africa, Julius Berger, and Fidson Healthcare. Analysts Cordros Capital Limited said: “Pre-MPC meeting, we observed that the upward re-pricing of yields on long-dated bonds triggered reduced appetite for equities among domestic institutional investors. “With the MPC maintaining the ‘lower-for-longer’ theme for rates, we expect a positive reaction in the equities market. Accordingly, we expect risk-averse investors to recalibrate their portfolio towards fundamentally sound stocks with attractive dividend yields.”
