The new structure will help countries identify risk in ‘sovereign stress’ and align with IMF’s lending framework, the Fund has announced yesterday.
  
According to the institution, the review was carried out on January 14. It stressed that the new framework, which comes with sweeping changes to the existing document, would be operational in the last quarter of the year/first quarter of 2022.
