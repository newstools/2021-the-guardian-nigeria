The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), yesterday, raised concerns over moribund oil and gas facilities across the country.
    
Speaking during a visit to one of such facilities, a fabrication yard located at Ilase Village, Snake Island, Lagos State, Director of DPR, Sarki Auwalu, said the development would limit domestic refining capacity and hinder projected benefits.
He insisted that the Federal Government was, however, committed to reactivating the moribund oil and gas support facilities across the country.
   
He added that the move was part of the government’s effort to increase domestic refining capacity and gas utilisation to curb unemployment and poverty in Nigeria.
   
Auwalu expressed dissatisfaction that the facility which was licensed to provide oil and gas service had not been operational since 2015 due to contractual issues.  Engineering Director, Kaztec Engineering Limited, Mike Simpson, said the facility became dormant in 2015 after its main contractor, Addax Petroleum, declared a force majeure on its operations.
   
Simpson said some of the unutilised equipment in the facility included a dive support vessel, pipe laying vessel and an already constructed Jacket that could be used for oil and gas operations. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
