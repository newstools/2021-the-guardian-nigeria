 Rauf Aregbesola  Minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, gave the advice in Abuja, when he received a delegation from the Executive Intelligence Management Course (EIMC) 14, of the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS), led by its Commandant, Ayodele Adeleke. The minister said Nigerians must avoid the temptation of giving ethnic colouration to criminal activities in the country. Aregbesola observed that Nigerians must equate security with the global picture of a society that puts its emphasis on the dignity of man and human development, as crime is an anathema to the nation. In a statement by Director of Press in the ministry, Mohammed Manga, the Minister called on the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS), as a security training institution, to see the need to develop a policy analysis that will ensure adequate reorientation of an average Nigerian to see crimes and criminality as they are. In his remarks, the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr. Shuaib Belgore, who enumerated the functions of the agencies under the ministry’s supervision, assured that government would continue to carry out its mandates, which are geared towards the protection of lives and property. Speaking earlier, the Commandant of the Institute, Ayodele Adeleke said his team was in the ministry to introduce the institution, which was saddled with the responsibility of training top security personnel.
