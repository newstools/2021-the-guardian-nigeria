Experts have suggested that the changes in the Finance Act 2020 would boost economic activities and create relief for Nigerian businesses.
  
They took this position at the executive roundtable on the Finance Act 2020 and Economic Outlook for 2021 organised by PwC Nigeria.
 
The virtual event held on Monday was targeted at CEOs, senior executives and medium and small scale enterprises (MSME). It focused on the impact of changes on the Finance Act and other government policies on businesses and taxpayers.  Fiscal Policy Partner and West Africa Tax Lead, PwC Nigeria, Taiwo Oyedele, who shared insights on how the Finance Act 2020 and other significant changes that have been made to existing laws would shape Nigeria’s tax environment, said there were no easy choices or a silver bullet given the limited fiscal space for incentives.
 
Providing the results of a survey on the Finance Act 2020 conducted by PwC, Oyedele revealed that respondents were asked to indicate which changes in the law they did not agree with. The survey said over half (59.7 per cent) said they did not agree with the idea of transferring unclaimed dividends and dormant account balances to a trust fund while 31.2 per cent did not agree with the plan to introduce excise duty on telecommunications services.
   
Country Senior Partner, PwC Nigeria, Uyi Akpata, noted that considering the impact the pandemic has had on Nigeria’s economy, it was important businesses understand the forces shaping Nigeria’s economy in 2021. He said the knowledge would help them minimise potential risks and take advantage of the fiscal policies the government had enacted to stimulate the recovery.
