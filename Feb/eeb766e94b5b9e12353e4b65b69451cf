The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who stepped down from royal duties to pursue normal family life, are preparing to welcome a brother or sister for their one-year-old son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, who will turn 2 on May 6. The spokesperson said: “We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to be expecting their second child.” Meghan, 39, and Harry, 36, announced their pregnancy news with a stunning black-and-white photo that was taken remotely via iPad by their friend and longtime photographer, Misan Harriman.
