Photo by PAUL ELLIS/POOL/AFP Liverpool have slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Leicester City, who came from a goal down to defeat the Premier League champions and all but end the Reds chances of retaining the league title. If there were any lingering thoughts of Liverpool launching a late run for the title, they were thoroughly quashed by seven wild minutes as goals from James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, and Harvey Barnes erased a beautifully worked Mohamed Salah opener. Liverpool goalie was at fault for Leicester’s second after another howler but the story was all about Liverpool whose return to form looked to be on for the first hour of the encounter. But a seven-minute collapse saw Jürgen Klopp’s side lose three successive Premier League games for the first time since November 2014. Current Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers was in charge of the Reds at the time. The Premier League champions looked in relative control and deservedly led when Salah broke the deadlock after 67 minutes but Klopp’s side imploded to slip six points behind their opponents. Maddison hauled Leicester level when his free-kick was allowed to stand following VAR review for an offside call on Daniel Amartey on 78 minutes before a terrible breakdown in communication between Alisson and new boy Ozan Kabak allowed Vardy to tap home from close range in the 81st minute. Barnes then compounded Liverpool’s misery with a well-taken third four minutes later as Leicester moved up to second in the table ahead of the weekend’s remaining fixtures, with the Reds still fourth – 10 points behind leaders Manchester City having played two games more.
