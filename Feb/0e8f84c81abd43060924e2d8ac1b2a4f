Kodak Black Offers To Pay Tuition For Kids Of Slain FBI Agents Kodak Black has offered to pay the college tuition for the children of the two FBI agents who were shot dead last week, his attorney Bradford Cohen has said according to a report by Fox News. Two agents, Daniel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger, were killed during a raid in Sunrise, along with the suspect, who reportedly used a doorbell camera to watch and allegedly shoot the agents through a closed door as they approached the home. The letter, sent by Cohen, says that Kodak is aware of the difficulties of losing loved ones and grew up in a single-parent home. He reportedly said that he wants to ensure that the families of the agents don’t have to worry about paying for college in the future. In Cohen’s words: Kodak has always put kids first in his charitable donations. He has a passion for making sure kids in crisis are supported financially and emotionally. That being said, whatever he can do to help, he always offers his assistance. He gives his heartfelt condolences to the families and hopes his offer eases their pain. Black’s attorney Cohen reportedly has a contact within the FBI Miami Division who confirmed that the agents both had minor children. According to TMZ, Alfin has a 3-year-old while Schwartzenberger has two children: A 4-year-old and a 9-year-old. Black is among those to have recently received a sentence commutation from former President Donald Trump after being imprisoned for weapons charges. However, according to TMZ, he is still reportedly facing charges of sexual assault in South Carolina.
