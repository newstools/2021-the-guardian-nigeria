  Igboho, alongside his supporters, arrived in Abeokuta, the state capital and immediately proceeded to some troubled areas in Yewaland in Ogun West Senatorial District. His visit was in continuation of his campaign against the marauding herdsmen in the South-West. He had recently displaced some Fulani herdsmen in Igangan, Oyo State, a development, which had attracted knocks and kudos nationwide. Speaking with journalists, he insisted that Fulani herdsmen who engage in killing and kidnapping must vacate the region for peace to reign. He said: “We observe there is an injustice from the herdsmen because they are close to the Federal Government. Any Fulani herdsman who engages in kidnapping should be flushed out. “Not only Igangan, but we are also going to visit all Yorubaland. I am going to Yewa because that is where the Fulani are wreaking havoc. “Let us thank the governor of the state. His love for people of Ogun State made him allowed us to visit the state. If not for his love for the people of Ogun State, he would not have allowed us to come to the state.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
