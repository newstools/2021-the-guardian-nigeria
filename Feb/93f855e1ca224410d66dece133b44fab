 Players and officials of the South South team celebrating their victory at the National U-17 Cricket Championship, which ended in Benin… at the weekend.  The victors recorded 93 runs in a tight 40 over finals match to beat the North-West team, who looked poised to defend the title they won last year in Abuja until the second innings when the bowling firepower of the South-South team came to the fore. Explaining his strategy for victory, Coach Ibodeme said he came into the game with faith in the talents and discipline of his team. “We are very happy to be the winning team, it did not come easy; our boys deserved it and worked really hard for it,” he enthused. The South South team halted Northwest at 57 all out to emerge victorious. At the end of the game, Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) President, Professor Yahaya Ukwenya said he was particularly proud of the level of skill and talents on display and it has proven that they were on the right path. “We had these teenagers display high level of performance at every point in this championship, which is a nice feedback for us at the kind of work being done at different regions. “Some players have shone at this event and will get a chance to prove themselves at the national U-19 camp when it opens ahead of the World Cup qualifiers that we are hosting later in the year,” he said. Tolulope Adeleke, who represented PwC at the event, said his company’s partnership with NCF was an expression of shared value of team work, integrity and professionalism. The National U-17 Cricket Championship was run in the regions where states competed and winners emerged and raised a regional team that had players from competing states. The South South team had players from Edo, Delta, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. South West finished in third place at the event.
