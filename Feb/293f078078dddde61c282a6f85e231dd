The platform is created for women to come out and say their owin stories of how workplace violence is affecting them and how they are either coping with the situation or how they have overcome it.” For the Programme manager, Inem King, the primary objective of the podcast is to inform the public about the existence and prevalence of workplace violence against women and detail its adverse effects on families, women, businesses, societies and economies. She also noted that the 10-episode series, which will run for nine weeks on different platforms will serve as a springboard for the recommendations to relevant stakeholders whose policies, regulations and rules can mitigate the menace. King also disclosed that the podcast will help stakeholders — women, men, workplaces, regulatory bodies, policymakers, among others — to better understand and tackle violence against women and create policy models that can be applied to workplaces across the continent.
