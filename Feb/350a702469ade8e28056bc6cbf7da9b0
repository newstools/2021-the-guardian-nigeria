Quoting a source within the State House, Peoples Gazzette reported that “Bashir got the appointment early January, but his documentation took place last week…It (the appointment) was delayed following the death of one of his friends, Jamilu Ibrahim Shinkafi, in an accident along Bauchi-Nasarawa Road, precisely in Akwanga in Nasarawa.” Ahmad has also denied the report. He said the story is “100% not true” and was a concocted claim. He also noted that he doesn’t even know where DPR office is. He said the only thing he knows about the organisation is that it is in Lagos. A day after Ahmad’s denial of the said employment, Peoples Gazette doubled down on its claim by publishing a letter it claimed was issued to the presidential aide. Apart from the denial from the DPR, President Buhari’s aide on digital communication Tolu Ogunlesi described the letter first published on Twitter by Peoples Gazette as “One of the worst, most embarrassing forgeries ever created.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
