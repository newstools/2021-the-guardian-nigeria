The United Nations in Somalia strongly condemns the terrorist attack on Hotel Afrik which left many people dead or injured.  “We are appalled by this reprehensible and senseless attack on a venue frequented by innocent civilians, and condemn it in the strongest terms,” the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Somalia, James Swan, said. According to reports, Al-Shabaab terrorists attacked the Hotel Afrik in Mogadishu on Sunday afternoon, and engaged in an hours-long siege before being dislodged by the Somali security forces. The United Nations in Somalia expresses its condolences to the families of the victims, and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured.
