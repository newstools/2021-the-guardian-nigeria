 Oscar N. Onyema  “NSE is committed to playing a critical role in the advancement of the FG’s financial inclusion goals.
 
“As part of our efforts to realise the objectives of the financial inclusion, we intend to facilitate conversations which will serve to equip existing and potential investors with the necessary skill to effectively manage and grow financial resources at their disposal.
 
“In these engagements, we will also expand the retail investment opportunities available in the capital market and the channels through which they can be accessed.”	 
 
Onyema applauded operators and investors in the market for their resilience with the COVID-19 pandemic. “The outbreak of COVID-19 adversely affected the global economy in many ways and at different magnitudes. The Nigerian capital market was also negatively affected, with the market witnessing a downturn in Q1 of this year.  “NISL is a securities trading company, financial advisory service, offering consulting solutions to corporate bodies across the value of activities on the Stock Exchange.
