The rain, which started at about 8:00 p.m., came with a heavy breeze which fell electric poles, trees and blew off roofs of houses. Areas affected are the Bank Road, New Iyin Road, NTA Road and Bashiri, all in the state capital. Structures that were damaged include those of the Federal Government agencies, state government, a church and a school. The wind also blew off large portions of the rooftops of the Ekiti State office of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), a section of JAMB office and other federal agencies’ property in the area. Also affected were the rooftops of the newly renovated Ekiti State Pavilion, the State House of Assembly, Seventh Day Adventist Church and state-owned All Souls Secondary School. Affected places visited by The Guardian were heavily waterlogged, while staff were seen using the early hours of Thursday to scoop water from the various offices. As of the time of filing this report, some of the offices affected were seen making emergency efforts to put things in shape, while others had started engaging carpenters to do repairs for the fear of another rainfall.
