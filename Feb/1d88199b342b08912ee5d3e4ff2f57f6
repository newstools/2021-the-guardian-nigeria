The Senate has resolved to investigate allegations of abuse of funds for the Safe Schools Initiative introduced by the Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2014. Adopting a motion sponsored by Stephen Adi (PDP, Cross River State) yesterday, the Senate also charged the Presidency to collaborate with the various state governments to restore, revive and revalidate the Safe School Initiative in Nigeria. According to the Senate, the latest twist in the criminal activities associated with insecurity in Nigeria, especially as it relates to the invasion of schools and kidnap of students and teachers for ransom, can be contained through the full implementation of the Safe School Initiative by all stakeholders. During the debate on the motion, Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, charged the red chamber to look into the allegation of abuse of the fund meant for the execution of the initiative.
