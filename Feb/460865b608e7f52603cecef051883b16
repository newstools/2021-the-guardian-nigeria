 Open Grazing  The Igbo leaders, who met at the behest of the Board Chairman, Prof. Anthony Ejiofor, urged the governors to match words with action and end herders/farmers’ clashes due to grazing on farmlands. “It is now time to match the words with action by establishing a task force that will prosecute the open grazing offenders and declare the use of bushes for human habitation a crime. “We want to see Open Grazing Prohibition Task Force that will enforce the anti-grazing rules established in the states.,” the congress stated. WIC also called on South-East governors and political leaders to embrace the Eastern Security Network (ESN) “for the protection of life and property of our homelands.” MEANWHILE, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday dispelled rumours that an ethnic or regional group had been ordered to quit Igboland. The National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, viewed the statement as reprehensible and highly unacceptable. He said: “We are aware of the various interest groups with weird claims on leadership of Ndigbo. However, Ndigbo recognise the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide led by Prof. George Obiozor as the apex authority on such matters of national importance. “It is, therefore, very instructive that the general public is hereby emphatically advised to always verify the sources of information regarding the position of Ndigbo on sensitive national issues.” According to him, the Igbo are very hospitable and hardworking. “They adapt themselves to legitimate businesses in all parts of Nigeria and the world. The Igbo are known to promote cordial relationships all over the world. It is therefore highly inconceivable for a sensible Igbo group to issue a quit notice to non-Igbo who are engaged in lawful means of livelihood in Igboland,” he added.
