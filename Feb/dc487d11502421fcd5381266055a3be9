3SC win, Delta Force lose points at home The Proprietor of Nilayo FC, Bukola Olopade, said the club will generate over N200 million from its marketing drive to run its affairs in the 2022 season. Olopade spoke at the weekend after Nilayo FC grabbed a 2-1 victory over Nnewi United at the MKO Abiola stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State in one of the opening matches of the 2021 Nigeria National League (NNL) Season. The visiting Nnewi United scored first in the fourth minute from a controversial penalty kick awarded by the referee. Goalkeeper, Ikenna Benjamin had jumped to save the ball in his area without a challenge from Nnewi United player, but the referee surprisingly blew his whistle and pointed to the box at the disappointment of the few people inside the stadium. The first half ended 0-1 in favour of Nnewi United, but FC Nilayo came back probing for goals in the second half, which paid off in the 47th minute when Muri Batuli’s defense splitting pass found James Ekebuike, who made no mistake in dispatching the ball into the net. Kabiru Popoola later made scores 2-1 from the penalty spot in the 55th minute when a defender of Nwewi United handled the ball in the box. Speaking with journalists at the end of the match, Olopade said his club was working hard to generate over N200 million from its marketing drive, adding that Nilayo Marketing Company would add glamour to the NNL through branding of the stadium it operates. The MKO Abiola Stadium, which hosted the encounter on Sunday, wore a new look courtesy of the branding by Nilayo Sports Management.
Olopade praised players and officials of Nilayo FC for a done well done by securing the first win, just as he advised other clubs featuring in the NNL League to seek for a way of sustainability to be independent of government control. “Nilayo FC is purely a privately owned club, but we thank Ogun State government for its support for us.” Nilayo FC will face Vandrezzer FC in Lagos for its match day two encounter. Vandrezzer secured a 0-0 draw against Delta Force FC despite playing with 10 men at the Jay Jay Okocha Stadium, Ogwashi-Uku, on Saturday. In other NNL matches played at the weekend, Gateway United suffered a 0-3 defeat against Joy Cometh FC at the Agege Township Stadium, Lagos, just as Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan, got their campaign off to a flying start by beating Rovers FC of Calabar 3-0 at the Dipo Dina Stadium, Ijebu-Ode.
