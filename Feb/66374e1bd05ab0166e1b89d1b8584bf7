Larry King’s Estranged Wife Fights Against Will After Exclusion Larry King’s estranged wife Shawn has reportedly filed court papers to challenge the will after she was cut out of it. The popular talk host legend died at the age of 87 in January after battling with Coronavirus. However, before his death, he has his will planned out. In his latest will, Larry planned for his money to be “divided equally among my children”. The will was signed and dated October 2019, which was around two months after Larry filed for divorce from his seventh wife Shawn. Shawn, 61, has reportedly asked for the 2015 will, written when they were together, to be recognised as the true will in which she’ll be named executor of the estate. Her lawyers allegedly filed the claims to a court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a report by The Mirror. Apparently, the actress said the couple, who were in the middle of divorce proceedings, were considering staying together just before her estranged husband’s death, new papers claim. According to the Court Document as reported by The Mirror; At the time of Larry’s death, there was a divorce proceeding that had been pending for quite some time. Larry was not pushing the divorce and was generally nonresponsive and refused to participate in the divorce proceeding. He gave no indication that he actually wanted to pursue a divorce. Larry and Shawn tied the knots in 1997 just before Larry underwent heart surgery. In 2010, they almost separated but got back together. However, in 2019, they filed for divorce. Larry’s surviving children are Larry Jr., Chance, and Cannon. His children Chaia and Andy both tragically died within three weeks of each other unexpectedly last year.
