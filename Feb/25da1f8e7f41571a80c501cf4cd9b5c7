The establishment of N2billion Rabelat Entrepreneurship Centre for Animal Husbandry (RECAH) in Ilorin, Kwara State, is expected to improve the internally generated revenue (IGR) of the state as well as create over 50,000 jobs. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, made this known, Tuesday, while assuring investors of government’s support for  growth of their businesses.
 
Adebayo spoke while addressing a delegation of Daniel Franco Institute, who visited him to seek support in the setting up of the centre. He stressed that the government would continue to do its best to make the country a safe destination for investors. He said the Ministry has the mandate of facilitating the development of viable non-oil commodities and food production, stressing the importance for the government to engage the institute to deliberate on the nature of strategic partnership and the level of collaboration expected.
   
Managing Director of Rabelat Nigeria, Dr. Ahmed Raji, said RECAH was structured to run both training and commercial outfits for animal husbandry.
 
According to him, the training arm will focus on the basic studies in animal husbandry and entrepreneurship, providing the platform for trainees to select, breed, care-for, process and market livestock.
   
He put the cost of the project at N2 billion, stressing that the amount will be spent on the construction of administration block and lecture halls, hostel, purchase of teaching aids and construction of facilities. He listed the benefits of RECHA to include aiding and fast-tracking the development of agribusiness in the country, creation of 50,000 jobs and solving the problem of herdsmen-farmers clashes.
  
Raji solicited the support of the minister towards the setting up of the institute, noting that the project would enhance the growth of agriculture.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
