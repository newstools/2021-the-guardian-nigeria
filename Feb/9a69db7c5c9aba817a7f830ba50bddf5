Fast-rising Afrobeats sensation, Yusuf Oluwo better known in the entertainment circle as Yusuf Kan Bai, is one act looking to fill the void that seems to have been created by silence of vocal wizkid, Wande Coal. Despite the pandemic-induced lockdown, the soulful singer had a breezy 2020 with his double feature on Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) Season 5 winner, Olamilekan Agbeleshe, who well known as Laycon’s Extended Play (EP), Who is Laycon? and his EP, Hear Me Out. The singer has just released a visual for the second track of his EP, Dey Your Dey, an S3nami assisted Oshofree with the up-tempo. Featuring Zlatan, YKB sings playfully about shedding off bad energy and remaining in his own private space while doing all the things that he desires. Known for his confrontational lyrics and raps like: “why people like to diss? Why people like to beef? Why my brother dey pray make I fall?” Zlatan, addressed the notion that most times, it’s the people that you love and care about that plot your downfall. The Gizzle produced single is an affirmation of YKB’s talent and his determination to conquer the Afrobeats space. His songwriting skills are top-tier, which handsomely reflects his youth, wittiness, and affinity for wet body parts. YKB often mentions Wande Coal as his biggest inspiration and role model.
