It also featured playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. Davido gave viewers an entertaining virtual performance with his live band on the 24th of February 2021. He performed from home as he dished out hits like Risky and Jowo on the set of NPR’s Tiny Desk. Opening the set, he and his band beautifully performed a unique rendition of “Gobe,” his smash 2013 single. He then concluded with “Jowo” from his new album, “A Better Time”. During his performance on NPR’s Tiny Desk, Davido cited his father as a source of inspiration. He said: A Nigerian American like myself that studied in the States…I went to an HBCU, you know… My dad went to one as well and my dad used to work at Burger King. To become what he’s become today as a Black man starting off in America has been very, very inspiring to me. Watch his performance below:
