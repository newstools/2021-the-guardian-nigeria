 Akeredolu  Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has sent to the state’s House of Assembly a bill to enact into law the anti-grazing law and to establish ranches across the 18 local councils of the state. He said the execution of the law would be controlled by state and local council-led committees jointly controlled by the governor, adding that the bill contains the establishment of ranches and grazing areas with the sole objectives of preventing the destruction of farm crops and property occasioned by open grazing. The state’s Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Donald Ojogo, disclosed this while briefing journalists after the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting at the Governor’s Office, Alagbaka, Akure. Ojogo said the SEC, among other things, also approved the procurement of additional 20 operational vehicles for the state Security Network, code-named: “Amotekun Corps.” The commissioner, who reiterated the ban on the operation of commercial motorcycle operators beyond 6:00 p.m. to further beef up the security in the state, said: “The ban on Okada is still in order. The cabinet decided that this ban should be reinforced.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Omolola Fagbemi, has announced that the council has approved and ratified the selection of Adeleke Adefemi Adedoyin from the Owa Ale Ruling House as the Owa-Ale-elect of Ikare-Akoko in Akoko North-East Local Council of the state.
