Fashola, who was represented by the federal controller of works in Edo State, Ademola Aransiola said of the 29 completed roads, 17 had been handed over in 2020 while assuring that the President Mohammadu Buhari-led administration is poised to bridge infrastructural gaps through a gradual process of repairs and construction in major highways and higher institutions. He noted that while a lot of work needed to be done in many sectors of national life, including education, President Buhari has stepped up to lead the process of getting that work done. He said: â€œCurrently, there are 43 road interventions within tertiary institutions across Nigeria, and students are expressing renewed enthusiasm with regard to attending classes because some defective roads have been restored.
