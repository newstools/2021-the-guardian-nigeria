But after heavy snow in the German capital, the plane’s de-icing took longer than expected and air traffic control refused permission for take-off due to a 00h00-07h00 (2300-0600GMT) ban on flights. Bayern had to disembark the Qatar Airlines plane which had been due to leave at 2315 but in the end, was only given the all-clear for departure one minute before the flight curfew began. The German champions, who have a semi-final against Egypt’s Al-Ahly on Monday, were forced to remain at the airport overnight, eventually leaving a few minutes before 0700, but this time with a stopover in Munich to change airline crew. “We had the impression that the competent authorities didn’t care about us,” an irate Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Bayern’s chairman, told Bild. “Those in charge (at the airport) don’t have an inkling of what they’ve done to our team.” Bayern Munich’s German forward Thomas Mueller (L) and Hertha Berlin’s German midfielder Sami Khedira walk on the pitch during the German first division Bundesliga football match between Hertha BSC Berlin and FC Bayern Munich in Berlin on February 5, 2021.
