The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Prof Victor Adetiloye, has disclosed that the institution has successfully managed a 101-year-old woman with COVID-19. Adetiloye, who disclosed this in Ile-Ife, yesterday, said it had never happened in Nigeria that a coronavirus patient of that age survived the infection. He said: “This woman was admitted and treated at the private hospital for malaria, but when the condition worsened, she was screened for COVID-19 and tested positive and she was later referred to our isolation centre.” “She was in a state of comma, placed on oxygen when she was admitted, but thank God for our professionals that successfully revived her.” He commended the Federal Government, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Ministry of Health for their support and for producing the facilities and drugs needed for the patients.
