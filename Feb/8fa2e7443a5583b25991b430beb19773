 PDP office  They are the former Deputy Speaker, who represents Akoko-Edo 1, Yekini Idaiye and his Orhionmwon East Constituency counterpart, Nosayaba Okunbor. Speaker of the House, Marcus Onobun read their letters of resignation on the floor of the House. “I took this decision because of the internal crisis in the party from my ward to the council level, which led to the factions in the party for some time now. “It is on this note that I decided to resign my membership of the APC and officially defect to the PDP,” Idaiye’s resignation letter reads. On his part, Okunbor said his decision to resign from APC followed the division within the party, which he said, had become intractable. “I have made strenuous efforts to ensure that the division within the party is reconciled in line with the provision of its constitution, but to no avail as the leadership of the party has refused to allow the issues to be adjudicated upon. “Consequently, I have no other option than to resign my membership, as lean liberty they say, is better than fat slavery,” he said.
