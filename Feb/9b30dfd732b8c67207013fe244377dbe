The police in Osun State have arrested a woman, Funmilayo Olalere, for beating her grandchild till she lost her eyes.	The grandmother, who lives in Amondo village, near Ile-Ife, was accused of assaulting her grandchild living with her. It was gathered that the suspect beat the victim with a broom, which stocked in one eye and damaged it. Rather than taking the victim to a hospital after she sustained the injury, the grandmother was said to have opted for self-treatment and applied urine on the eye. The Osun State government, on Wednesday, said it ordered the arrest of the woman. It was said that the suspect had been referred to the Osun Women’s Clinic, where she would undergo psychotherapy pending her arraignment in court. The Osun State Commissioner for Women, Children and Social Affairs, Olubukola Olaboopo, said her ministry got information that the suspect, popularly called ‘Iya Ibeji Olowo,’ used a broom on the child. “Based on the information, we traced the address, which is very remote and the ministry caused the woman to be arrested; she is to be charged to court soon. “I advise parents and guardians to be humane while disciplining their children, as any violence against children would be met with stiff penalty,” the commissioner said.
