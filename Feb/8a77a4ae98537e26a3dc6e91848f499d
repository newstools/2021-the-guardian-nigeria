John Legend Loses His Grandmother After Her 91st Birthday Celebration John Legend has paid tribute to his grandmother who died just days after celebrating her 91st birthday. The 42-year-old award-winning musician issued a statement celebrating the life of Marjorie Maxine Stephens who passed away on Tuesday. John and wife Chrissy Teigen, 35, recently suffered a tragedy when their baby son, Jack, passed away last September. Addressing his latest heartbreak, John shared a string of photos on Instagram showing Marjorie looking happy with family members. Leading with an image of Marjorie wearing a vibrant pink dress, and with John’s arm around her, the musician wrote: My beautiful grandmother, Marjorie Maxine Stephens, left this world early this morning, just a few days after her 91st birthday. We are so grateful for the life she lived, for the love she shared with her many children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. She was the most caring and conscientious grandmother you could imagine. She still sent us all birthday cards with cash until her final days. As John’s tribute continued, he painted a picture of a woman at the very heart of his family. He wrote: She hosted our yearly Christmas celebrations until we literally couldn’t fit in her little pink house on Heard Avenue in Springfield, Ohio. She was active and full of curiosity and energy until her final days. She always had a story to tell and words of encouragement and love. She supported us and rooted for us unconditionally. I’m so glad she got to see the fruits of all she gave us. She got to travel the world with us, went to my first Grammys. She got to experience the successes of all her offspring. We are the family we are, the individuals we are because of the love she poured into us. We are sad to lose her but most of all so appreciative of the full, blessed life she lived. May she Rest In Peace after running a great race. John was met with messages of condolence and support by fans.
