Justice  Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court, Lagos, has ordered the interim attachment of all monies belonging to Forte Oil Plc and Veritas Registrars Limited in 21 banks in Nigeria over alleged N464 million debt. The court also ordered the banks to jointly or severally appear before it to show cause why they shall not jointly or/and severally pay the judgment creditors who had unclaimed judgment against Forte oil and Veritas Registrars, the judgment debtors.
 
The order followed a Garnishee Nissi proceeding filed by Fidelity Finance Company Limited, Mr. Osa Osunde and Mr. Nosa Osunde through their counsel Onyebuchi Aniakor and Mrs. Pamela Umegbu-Amedo in respect of the sum awarded against Forte oil and Veritas Registrars by Investment & Securities Tribunal, Abuja.
