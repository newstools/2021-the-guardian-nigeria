While there is absolutely nothing wrong with paying homage to the style of a woman in power; it is also important to heed her wisdom. There are many girls and women who may be posing with an ankara head tie and a pair of spectacles but being like an icon is not about a token photo on a social media feed. It is about learning from their experience and her wisdom, so here are some nuggets of wisdom from Okonjo-Iweala. On style
I’ve developed my own style. It’s a colourful one. It’s African and it is me. On leadership
If you have a sense of purpose that drives you, then aim high and become a leader and make the room as you go. Investing in women and girls
Investing in women is smart economics, and investing in girls, catching them upstream is even smarter economics. On finding solutions
I believe that when you find problems, you should also find solutions. On networking
Don’t take a backward step. Don’t shy away from taking up space in the world. Don’t assume you are too junior or that people are too busy. Reach out and network. On ego
When it comes to doing my job, I keep my ego in my handbag. On African development
Africans… their tired. They’re tired of being the subject of everybody’s charity and care. We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. On gender stereotypes
