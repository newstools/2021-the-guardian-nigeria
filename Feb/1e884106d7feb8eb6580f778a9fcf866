 The seized drugs  The suspected fake military officers, Mohammed Nura and Abubakar Dahiru, were intercepted by operatives of the Kogi State command of the NDLEA on the Okene-Lokoja expressway on Monday, February 15, 2021. According to the commander, Kogi State Command of the anti-drug agency, Mr. Adewunmi Alfred, the Hilux Jeep was properly searched during which 394 compressed blocks of cannabis sativa were discovered in different compartments of the vehicle. “Our initial investigations have revealed that the consignment was taken from Lagos and heading to Kano for delivery. Though the two men identified themselves as military officers, that did not sway our men from a thorough search of their vehicle and the result was the discovery of the illicit drugs tucked in every hidden part of the vehicle. Indeed, we suspect the two men to be fake military officers until proven otherwise,” he stated in a brief to the chairman of the NDLEA, General Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd), on Monday. He added that the vehicle had been impounded, the illicit drugs seized and the suspects detained for further investigation. “Investigations have commenced and the outcome would be forwarded for further directives and appropriate action,” he added.
