The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to speak on what it called “alleged complicity of the military and certain officials of the Presidency” in the abduction of 300 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State by terrorists. The party described as alarming allegations in the public space, especially by the Northern Youth Movement (NYM), of compromises by the military, which paved way for the invasion of the school reportedly located less than 100 metres from a military checkpoint. The party, in statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, demanded explanations to reports that “soldiers stormed the community two hours earlier and ordered residents to clear the streets and retire to their houses, only for the bandits to invade the town, assaulted the school and carted away 300 innocent girls without any impediment. “There are already insinuations in the public space that the abduction was plotted by unscrupulous high-level officials of the Buhari Presidency, who are allegedly benefitting from the insurgency, terrorism and banditry going on in our country,” the party said. In tasking the Buhari Presidency over the perplexing reports, PDP particularly demanded that the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Babagana Monguno, should come clean on the allegations that the escalation of acts of terrorism, including the rampant kidnapping of students, were masterminded to heat up the polity and justify the demand for huge allocations for anti-terrorism efforts. “Our party and, indeed, all well-meaning Nigerians, insist that the Buhari Presidency must not keep quiet in the face of these huge allegations, but immediately clear the air and restore confidence in the hearts of Nigerians, before it is too late,” the statement said.
