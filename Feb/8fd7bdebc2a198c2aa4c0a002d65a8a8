Six Held After Tinseltown’s Famous Sign Changed To ‘Hollyboob’ Six people have been held in custody after altering Los Angeles’ landmark Hollywood sign to read “Hollyboob,” according to a report by France24. Photos shared online showed the sign, which overlooks the Hollywood hills, with the W and D replaced with Bs. According to local outlet NBC Los Angeles, the group was activists trying to raise awareness about breast cancer and used large sheets of tarpaulin to make the edits. They did not cause any permanent damage to the sign, a policeman informed the media. LAPD Hollywood police chief Captain Steve Lurie said the stunt was “way uncool” in a Twitter post. A few hours ago, a group attempted to vandalize the Hollywood sign. Los Angeles landmarks are precious to those of us @LAPDHollywood and this was way uncool (not to mention the terrain is quite steep & dangerous). Hollywood patrol officers have arrested all six individuals. — Captain Steve Lurie (@LAPDLurie) February 1, 2021  The incident is far from the first time the landmark has been modified, having been edited on three separate occasions by marijuana-loving locals to read “Hollyweed.”
