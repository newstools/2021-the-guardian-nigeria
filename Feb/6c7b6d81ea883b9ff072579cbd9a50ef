Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen PHOTO: Twitter Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, has promised to collaborate with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) to tackle human trafficking, prostitution and child labour in the country. The information is in a statement issued by Mr Shehu Maikai, the Director of Press of the ministry on Tuesday. Maikai stated that Tallen made the promise when the Director-General of NAPTIP, Mrs Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, paid
a solidarity visit to the ministry. He quoted the minister as saying “women and children are the worse hit in the area of human trafficking, hence the promulgation of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act and the Child Rights Act. “If NAPTIP and the ministry work together, both organisations would be in a better position to checkmate incidences of women trafficking, prostitution and child labour.” The NAPTIP boss also said that the collaboration would be in areas of economic empowerment for women and children; training of personnel and advocacy visits. She said “you will agree with me that the articles of trade in human trafficking are women and children. It is therefore important for NAPTIP to work with the Ministry of Women Affairs so that together we shall succeed.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
