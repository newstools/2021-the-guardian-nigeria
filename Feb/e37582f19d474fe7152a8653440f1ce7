 [FILE] Member of the Senate, Alhaji Ali Ndume  The senator, who lamented last Thursday’s terrorist attacks on the areas, urged security agencies to intensify their efforts towards securing lives and property and restoring peace in the Northeast region. Speaking in an interview in Maiduguri, yesterday, Ndume noted that the renewed attacks in Gur, Zira I & II, Egiri villages in Biu local council of the state has forced people to flee for safety. According to him, the insurgents that operate in gun trucks and motorcycles torched several houses and shops. He stated that last week’s attack in Marte local council was particularly worrisome, as Governor Babagana Zulum returned the residents in January 2021. He, therefore, called on the humanitarian agencies, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to immediately provide relief items to victims of the recent attacks. His words: “I want to strongly condemn renewed attacks by Boko Haram in some parts of Borno and Yobe states, which claimed many lives and properties worth billions of naira. “Tens of thousands of innocent residents were also displaced into camps and host communities without shelter and protection. “Although security agencies are doing well in the fight against Boko Haram and other criminalities, I urge them, particularly the military, to intensify efforts towards restoration of peace in the region. “The renewed attacks on my constituency of Gur, Zira I & II, Egiri villages in Biu local council forced thousands of people to be displaced after the destruction of their houses and property. “I, therefore, call on the humanitarian agencies including NEMA and SEMA, among others, to immediately provide relief items to victims of the recent Boko Haram onslaught on the region.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
