Indications emerged, yesterday, that former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, might defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). This came to the fore after Fani-Kayode met separately with Governors Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Malam Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State who chairs the caretaker committee of the APC on registration and revalisation of party members at a Guest House in Wuse, Abuja. Though details of what transpired at the parley held behind closed doors were yet to be known, it is believed Fani-Kayode, who dumped the APC for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015 may return to the APC fold soon. Fani-Kayode, in his twitter handle, claimed that the parley between him and Buni was in the best interest of the country. “It was an honour to have spent quality time with my friend and brother, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State last night. We had a frank, candid, fruitful and productive discussion about the way forward for our country. This is a clear case of politics without bitterness and of building bridges,” he said.
