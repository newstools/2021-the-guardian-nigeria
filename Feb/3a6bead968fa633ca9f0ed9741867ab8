 [FILES] Samuel Ortom. Photo: IREPORTERS  Deputy Speaker, Bauchi State House of Assembly, Danlami Kawule, has warned Ortom to watch his utterances, arguing that his position was criminalising all the citizens of the state. Danlami was reacting to the governor’s statement when he asked herders, who could not obey the law of the state to relocate to Bauchi, where they would be allowed to carry AK-47. The lawmaker described Ortom’s position as an insult and allegation that Bauchi is lawless. He asked Ortom to tender apology to the people of Bauchi, and to put the unity and security of every citizen first. Also, Arewa Youths for Peace and Development called out Ortom for allegedly calling Mohammed a “terrorist”. Chairman of the group, Alhaji Salihu Mohammed, at a press conference, said every one in Nigeria knew Mohammed as a nationalist. He said: “No matter what, to call him a terrorist is unacceptable, erroneous, unfair and we demand an unreserved apology from Ortom to all Nigerians for fanning the embers of disunity in the country over his utterances and reckless statements and actions.” Meanwhile, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, (MACBAN) in Bauchi State said the Benue governor is planning to cause trouble in the country with his utterances. The chairman, Sadiq Ahmad, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the two leaders to order to avert putting the country in danger. “The President should address the leaders who are violating the Constitution, denying people’s rights,” he said.
