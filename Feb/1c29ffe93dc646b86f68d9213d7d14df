An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti has sentenced one 27-year-old Farotimi Samuel to life imprisonment for conspiracy and rape. Justice Adekunle Adeleye said: “I hold that the prosecution has established the ingredients of the offence of rape against the defendant beyond reasonable doubt. He is found guilty as charged. He is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment.” According to the charge sheet, the act was committed on or about January 29, 2018 at Oke-Ureje, Federal Polytechnic Road, Ado Ekiti, when the accused conspired with others at large to rape a 14-year-old girl. The offence is contrary to sections 516 of the Criminal Code, 31 of the Child Right Law, Cap C16 and C7, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. In her testimony before the court, the victim said she went to buy garri and sugar, and on her way home, she was stopped by three men, who covered her mouth and later took her to an uncompleted building where they all had sex with her, adding that she could recognise the accused person among them. To prove his case, the prosecutor, Mr Olawale Fapohunda, called five witnesses, while the accused confessional statement was tendered as exhibit. The accused spoke in his own defence through his counsel, Chris Omokhafe and called no witness. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
