The Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, has declared that trucks not registered under ‘Eto’, the electronic truck-call up app, would not have access to the ports from February 27, 2020.
   
Speaking during a webinar, Bala Usman said that trucks found parking on any part of the ports access roads when the scheme takes off would be impounded. She explained that all trucks are expected to be parked at designated truck parks from where they would be called into the ports when their cargo is ready for pick.
   
As part of the operation of the ‘Eto’ app, the NPA boss said that the Authority, in conjunction with the Lagos State Government, has licensed seven parks, where trucks could be stationed and invited into the ports when their cargoes are ready for pick up.  We have had pushbacks from shipping companies in the past, but what we have now is to deny their 2021 registration unless they provide empty container holding bays and log on to Eto. We are happy that they have complied.”
   
Bala Usman explained that the NPA is working with the Lagos State Government and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to ensure full compliance with Eto operations and that trucks found around the ports without being called to the ports will be impounded and their owners made to face the law.
