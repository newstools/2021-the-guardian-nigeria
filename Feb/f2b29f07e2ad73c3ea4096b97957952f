 Fani-Kayode  Ojudu spoke yesterday while revalidating his membership of the APC at Ereguru area, Ward 8, Ado Ekiti local council of Ekiti State. According to him, people like the former minister were not needed in the APC despite the ongoing membership registration exercise in the party geared towards attracting new members. His words: “Members of our party have spoken. They have expressed their displeasure that anybody who could boldly abuse the president and insult the vice president; denigrate our party and a section of Nigeria is not welcome in our party. That is my position and the generality of our party members. “If Fani-Kayode has decided to come, he has seen the sign that he is not welcome at the party. We need people in our party, but it should be those who have characters that one can be proud of.” On next year’s governorship election in Ekiti State, Ojudu said progressive politicians within the fold of the APC would ensure that a committed democrat emerges as the successor to Governor Kayode Fayemi. He noted that it was too early for him to declare interest in the race, adding, however, that no one would be allowed to impose anyone as governor of the state. He denied having serious problems with the governor, saying, “all I have with the governor is just political differences and not a crisis.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
