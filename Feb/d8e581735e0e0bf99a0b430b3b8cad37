This formed part of the findings in a study on “The Challenges and Survivability of ISP Licensees in the Nigerian Telecom Sector.” The study was authored by the Emerging Technologies Research Unit of the Research and Development Department of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).
   
The report, which noted that survival and growth are the two main objectives of any organisation in today’s competitive world, said every organisation tries to be different and accelerative from their competitors to achieve their goals and become market leaders.
 
For licensed ISPs in Nigeria, which NCC puts at 143, as at October 26, 2020, the study said survivability entails overcoming the major challenge of improving customer base and competing with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).
