Dr Winston Udeh, an aspirant in the Nov. 6 governorship election in Anambra, on Friday donated one Sienna bus to each of the 21 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Local Government Area chapters in the state. Udeh, a lawyer handed the 21 vehicles to Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, chairman of PDP in Anambra and members of the State Executive Council at the party Secretariat in Awka. He said the vehicles were to facilitate the movement of the party to the nooks and crannies to mobilise the people of Anambra ahead the election. He promised to continue to provide logistics support for the party that would be needed to prosecute and ensure victory for the PDP. Udeh also used the occasion to inform the party of his intention to contest for the ticket of the party and promised to help PDP achieve victory in the gubernatorial election. He said he was in the race for the Anambra Government House to make the people of the state ‘smile again’. In his response, Nwobu thanked the benefactor for donating the vehicles and assured that hey would be used for the purpose they were meant for. He said the party had been receiving donations of vehicles but this is the first time the PDP has received a single largest donation of 21 vehicles. He said that the PDP would contest the election on the strength of its manifesto and quality candidates, warning that it would not allow anybody to use ‘known and unknown’ force to capture the state. The chairman urged party faithful to remain united, explaining that the PDP was on a mission to redeem Anambra from bad leadership.
