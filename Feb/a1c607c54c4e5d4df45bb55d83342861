The National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has pleaded with the Minister of health and all relevant stakeholders to call the Chairman, Medical & Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) Prof. Abba Hassan to order to prevent crisis in the already fragile health sector, at this critical time of COVID-19 pandemic. The plea was due to the statement credited to Hassan during the induction ceremony of foreign-trained medical doctors that house officers should not be part of any association. He threatened MDCN will punish any found culpable. NARD leadership, in a statement, frowned at the utterance, referring MDCN to its Act, Cap 221 where the membership of House officers is unequivocally captured. The statement signed by NARD President, Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, NARD Secretary General, Dr Jerry Isogun and NARD Publicity/Social Secretary, Dr Dotun Osikoya said NARD, as a body, has been at the forefront of advocacy for central placement of house officers. “We have fought and will continue to engage all relevant authorities for an improved remuneration and condition of service for house officers. Thus, we will resist any attempt by MDCN to cause confusion in the health sector. The MDCN should focus on its duties of central placement of house officers and payment of house officers for January, as this is bringing hardship to our members,” the statement maintained.
