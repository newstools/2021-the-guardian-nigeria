 Iba Gani Adams  The Secretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, made the call, at the weekend, during an interview with The Guardian in Ibadan,  the Oyo State capital. Olajide, who is the Aare of Efon Kingdom, said the governors must realise that they did not have control over federal security outfits, hence Adams, Adeyemo and groups come handy for them to carry out their functions as chief security officers of their respective states. He said: “For me, irrespective of who of your children takes it upon himself to defend, protect and advance your interest, you will be happy that at least you have fathered a child that is courageous enough to do things in the moment of need. “However, going by the title of Aare OnaKakanfo, one would have expected him to be at the forefront of the struggle to liberate us from these criminal herders. But again, the questions arise – are we as Yoruba stakeholders funding him or are the state governments funding him? Where do we expect him to raise the funds to go into the forests with his men? That is another angle. So, there is a limit to the demand you can place on him. “Nevertheless, that title places a lot of responsibilities. So, we would have been very happy if Sunday ‘Igboho’ were part of his (Gani Adams’) army and generals liberating us from the criminal herders.” The YCE scribe said Adeyemo was the Yoruba messiah, saying: “If we don’t have Sunday ‘Igboho’ in this matter, the entire South-West would have been taken over by criminal herders. “What else do you want a messiah to do? A messiah redeems you from bondage and liberates you from captivity. This is precisely what he has done.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
