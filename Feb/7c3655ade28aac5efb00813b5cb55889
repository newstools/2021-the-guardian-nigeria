Well, hi there! The Sunday we have been looking forward to is finally here.

Catch up on all the trendy stories of last week: <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1235179 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="771" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille.jpg 780w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille-487x293.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille-320x193.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille-640x386.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lil-Frosh-and-Camille-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />

Sanni Goriola, better known as Lil Frosh, has moved from dropping bars to behind Ikoyi bars for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, Okeoghene Iyomaterie, who is also known as Gift Camille. The rapper pleaded not guilty to one count of assault at the Lagos State Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Recall that in October 2020, Mayoks Michael, Camille’s manager and brother, accused Lil Frosh of beating her up. He made the allegation along with images of a badly bruised Camille. Magistrate Adeola Olatunbosun, at the hearing, adjourned the case till March 9, 2021. She also ordered Lil Frosh to be remanded at the Ikoyi Correctional Centre. We guess the lesson is, the wrong hit can determine our relevance. Luck or fate?
In more positive news, a retired nun [Sister André], aged 117, has survived the coronavirus. Sister André, originally named Lucile Randon, is one of the 81 who tested positive in a retirement home housing 88 people, 10 of whom died. Blind and in a wheelchair, Sister André who was asymptomatic, lived through the 1918 flu pandemic and both world wars. Due to the pandemic, the nun who was gearing up for her 117th birthday spent her days isolated. This is different from her 115 birthday when Pope Francis sent her a letter, and a blessed rosary.
However, her victory over corona also means one thing; she is now the oldest living European and second-oldest person in the world. End of Fenty?
“Is the Fenty era over?” That is the question on everyone’s lips. One of Rihanna’s brand, Fenty Fashion label, which she started less than two years ago with Luxury goods group LVMH is shutting down. According to fashion critics and analysts, Rihanna’s huge fanbase has not translated to purchases as her fanbase considers her price high-end. Rihanna became the first woman of colour to launch and lead a house under the luxury brand in 2019.
However, the Savage X Fenty lingerie line will continue, as well as the cosmetics lines Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin. You can breathe now; we know, we held our breaths too. The hitman
A woman was charged to court after she was caught trying to hire a hitman online and pay with Bitcoin. The woman, Kelly Harper, surfed the net for murder-for-hire contracts from October to December. In one of her chats, Harper described the target, his vehicle’s plate number, workplace, and phone number. Fortunately, the bitcoin address with the murder price of $5,633.87 was used to track Harper. Now here is where it gets interesting: In Wisconsin, a murder does need to take place in a murder-for-hire contracts for the defendant to be found guilty. Fela | Image: Getty All hail the icon
