Marilyn Manson Being Probed By Police Over Fresh Domestic Abuse Allegations Music artiste, Marilyn Manson is being investigated by US police over allegations of domestic violence. This probe comes after allegations from at least five women who accused the Disposable Teens singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, of abuse. They include ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood, 33, who accused him of sexual misconduct, manipulation, physical and emotional abuse saying Manson “started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years”. Ashley Walters and Ashley Lindsay Morgan claimed they suffered sleep deprivation and Sarah McNeilly alleged that Manson “threatened to bash my face in with a baseball bat”. While former porn star Jenna Jameson said Manson, 52, fantasised about burning her alive. The goth singer has been dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Recordings, and fired from his role in fantasy TV drama, American Gods. Manson said his “intimate relationships have been entirely consensual” and branded the allegations as “horrible distortions of reality”. Earlier in the year, he addressed the issue of sexual allegations against him on his Instagram page, he wrote: Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth. Manson found fame in the 1990s and became known for his distinctive appearance.
