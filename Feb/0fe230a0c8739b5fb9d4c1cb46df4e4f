 Oyetola  He said governance is still uppermost in his mind and as such he would not want to be distracted at this critical stage of his tenure. To this end, he called on those behind the posters to tarry a while and wait for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to blow the whistle for the contest. Speaking on the development, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Ismail Omipidan, said his principal had no hand in the said posters. “For now, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is more preoccupied with mobilising the people for membership registration and revalidation exercise, while Oyetola is preoccupied with governance and not politicking. “The Governor appreciates the goodwill and the solidarity of those behind it, if truly they are genuine, but wishes to state that what is uppermost in his mind at the moment is to take Osun to greater heights. “He, therefore, appeals to those behind it to channel their efforts towards supporting government’s efforts at changing the fortune of the state, which would probably make 2022 unattractive to the opposition, “ Omipidan said.
