 Executive Governor of Kwara State Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq PHOTO:Twitter  Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, Mary Kemi Adeosun, said yesterday in a statement. However, former Secretary of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Kwara state chapter, Olusola Ajolore has criticised this, questioning the rationale for the closure after a very long time at home due to the COVID-19 lock-down. The affected schools are, Cherubim and Seraphim College Sabo Oke, St. Anthony College, Offa Road, ECWA School, Oja Iya, Surulere Baptist Secondary School, Bishop Smith Secondary School, Agba Dam, CAC Secondary School Asa Dam, St. Barnabas Secondary School Sabo Oke, St. John School Maraba, St. Williams Secondary School Taiwo Isale and St. James Secondary School Maraba. According to Adeosun, “the closure came as a government committee comprising representatives of the Muslim and Christian communities met yesterday to iron out the differences between the two communities and further communication will be issued to inform members of the public on the development.” They called for calm and urged parents and religious leaders to avoid actions or comments that may further split the two communities. Altercations at the main gate of Baptist Secondary School Surulere, Ilorin yesterday between parents who want hijab for their children and those opposed to it caused the government’s order of closure.
