Prior to his release, Shmurda in an Instagram Story wrote: “Thank you for remaining loyal and for riding this six year sentence out with me. I love you all and look forward to seeing you soon.” The first thing Shmurda did after being discharged was to call his mother Leslie Pollard on FaceTime to celebrate.

Prosecutors claimed the rapper had a leading role in the GS9 gang in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. The arrest came on the heels of massive viral popularity surrounding “Hot N—a” and the ubiquitous Vine where he threw his hat and hit the Shmoney Dance. At 19, he’d signed a massive record deal with Epic. In 2016, he accepted a plea deal that resulted in a seven-year sentence.
