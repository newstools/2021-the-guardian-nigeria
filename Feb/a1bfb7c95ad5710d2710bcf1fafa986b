MediaTek (www.MediaTek.com), the world’s fourth largest global fabless semiconductor company, today reiterated its commitment towards providing new-age technology solutions to enable the roll out of future ready smartphones in the South African market. MediaTek announced the launch of its premium gaming chip, MediaTek Helio G95, along with its offerings across the spectrum, including G90T, G85, G80, G70, G35, and G25 chips. Aimed at the premium 4G gaming smartphone segment, the semiconductor company has associated with global smartphone brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Infinix to launch up to ten premium, feature-rich smartphones, powered by MediaTek Helio G series, in 2021.  The powerful MediaTek Helio G95, with enhanced MediaTek HyperEngine gaming technology, features multi-camera support, unrivalled connectivity, and AI Super Resolution for video streams. MediaTek Helio G95 offers gaming enthusiasts faster performance and high-end features like advanced multi-camera photography – up to four cameras with an integrated AI processing unit (APU). The chip is also equipped with an ultra-low power, HDR10 standard display, which can be enhanced to approach HDR10+ quality in real-time. Other features include always-on DSP that supports dual wake-up word detection, ensuring seamless concurrence between two parallel Voice Wakeup (VoW) functions. The ultra-low power DSP minimises power consumption of applications such as the always-on Google Assistant and supports multiple keyword triggers and virtual assistants.  “South Africa is our top Smartphone market in Africa with annual shipments expected to grow towards 15 million in contrast to some decline globally. We have been actively enabling Africa with our innovative chips with the aim of facilitating transformative technology in the region and will continue to do so” said Rami Osman, Director for Corporate Sales and Marketing at MediaTek Middle East and Africa.  “MediaTek’s Helio G-Series is the latest generation in our Helio family of Chipsets for Smartphones that will continue our commitment to 4G connectivity and the adoption thereof.

Moreover, MediaTek is currently collaborating with MTN & Vodacom South Africa who have plans to accelerate the deployment of their 5G Networks.
