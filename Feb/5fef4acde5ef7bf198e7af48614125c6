Larry King’s $2 Million Fortune To Be Shared Among His Kids Larry King left behind an estate worth roughly $2 million to his children, having penned a handwritten will before two of his kids tragically died, according to a report by TMZ. The legendary broadcaster wrote his will specifying that all of his money should be “divided equally among my children Andy, Chaia, Larry Jr, Chance & Cannon.” The CNN star penned the will on Oct. 17, 2019, before Chaia, 51, and Andy, 65, passed away within a month of each other last year. Son Larry King Jr. is seeking for the court to appoint him as the administrator of his dad’s estate, given that the 87-year-old talk show host was still in the middle of the divorce when he died last month. The probate court papers estimated King to be worth $2 million, but that amount wouldn’t include any money that he may have put into trusts. Although Larry did not leave any money to his estranged wife, California law states that she would have “priority next after [his] brothers and sisters.” However, as one of Larry’s children, Larry Jr. “has a clear statutory priority to act as special administrator in this estate over Ms. King,” the petition noted. Larry died at the age of 87 on January 23 after being hospitalized with COVID-19 in December 2020 at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television, and digital media, Larry’s many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster.
