Alhaji Abdullahi Garundaye, the Secretary, Grains Merchants Association in the market, attributed the increase in prices to shortage of grains in the market due mostly to security issues. “Last year, many farmers did not grow crops in some parts of Borno as a result of incessant attacks by gunmen. “The few goods you are seeing in the market are those produced in Potiskum and other local government areas in Yobe that are safe to cultivate crops,” he said.
