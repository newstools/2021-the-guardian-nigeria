A Federal High Court, Abuja has given the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the permission to arrest the Managing Director of ExxonMobil Nigeria, Richard Laing. EFCC Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, said Justice Okon Abang on Friday, January 29, 2021, granted the commission’s application for a bench warrant to arrest Laing. He said the EFCC approached the court for a warrant after Laing snubbed three invitations from the commission. “EFCC is investigating alleged procurement fraud in the Major Integrity Pipelines Project involving Mobile Producing Nigeria, Suffolk Petroleum Services Limited, Saipem Contracting Nigeria, Global Offshore Limited and Van Ord as sub-contractor to SPSL. “The issue bothers on fraudulent creation of Change Orders worth over $213 million,” he said.
