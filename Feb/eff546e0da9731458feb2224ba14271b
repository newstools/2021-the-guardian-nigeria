The first daughter of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Fatimah Abubakar has denied media reports that she revalidated her membership with the All Progressives Congress (APC). The former commissioner for health in Adamawa State in a statement said the report was unfounded, noting that she no longer has a political affiliation. There were media reports that she revalidated her APC membership in Jada Local Government of the state with her signature duly attached to the documents. She said her signature on the APC revalidation documents in circulation was forged. Fatima recalled that in 2015 when she was appointed as commissioner, the condition was that she had to join the APC. According to her, “since I concluded my duty as commissioner, I have veered into private practice, with no political affiliation.” She said she was surprised to read her purported revalidation of APC membership. “for the avoidance of doubt, I did not revalidate any membership of APC which was necessitated by my call to service in 2015,” Fatima said. “Indeed, I have been in Abuja, never travelled to Jada where the purported revalidation was said to have taken place, and neither filled a form nor signed any document. The signature appended to the document in circulation is not my signature.” She urged the public to disregard the report claiming she revalidated membership of APC.
