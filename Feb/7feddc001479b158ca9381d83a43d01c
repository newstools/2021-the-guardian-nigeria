Renowned accountant and financial expert, Vera Augustine, yesterday urged Nigerian youths to engage themselves in meaningful ventures to earn a living, rather than involve themselves in fraud and dubious activities. In a statement in Abakaliki, Vela noted that this syndrome has made the youths lazy, warning that if this ugly trend is not tackled urgently, the future of our society is doom. Her words: “The sad truth is, among the joblessness, there are millions of jobs in Nigeria. The issue of using shortcuts to success is becoming the order of the day in Nigeria and it is sad. Every day, you see on the pages of newspapers arrest and conviction of Yahoo boys. Sadly, most of these guys are graduates. “So, the question is, did you spend four years in school to end up as a fraudster? Our youths need to have a rethink. It is high time they realise that the future of this country lies in their hands.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
