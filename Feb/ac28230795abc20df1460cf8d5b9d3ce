Igbobi College Lagos will battle with Government College Kaduna in the opening game of the National Principal Cup at the Agege Stadium, Lagos, the organising committee has revealed. The revived competition earlier scheduled to kick off on February 12 will now start from February 26. According to the Director of Grassroots Sports in the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Dr. Ademola Are, the change in kick off date of the Principals Cup was to sort out a few logistics and ensure a hitch free competition. The revival of the Principals Cup is one of the cardinal programmes of current Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, aimed at the re-invigoration of schools and grassroots sports development, enhance talent discovery and grooming of young talents in the country. This year’s edition will not only focus on football, but also on other sports like table tennis, badminton, athletics, boxing and volleyball. The Principal Cup competition has received high profile endorsement from the Ooni of Ife, His Royal Majesty Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja 11, who has instituted an award for the Most Valuable Player. The Ooni, who participated in the Headmasters Cup and Principals Cup while in primary and secondary school, commended the Dare for the initiative, which he believes will help cement national unity and forge friendship among youths across the country.
