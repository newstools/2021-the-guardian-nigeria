The 2021 Budget took off on schedule, but necessary reforms were not simultaneously effected. Meanwhile, the economy is in recession while the country remains the poverty capital of the world to boot. The Federal Government’s alibi for the recession is low crude oil prices occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the attendant economic lockdown. Nevertheless, examination of two IMF policy recommendations and a CBN policy measure on remittances, which occurred in November and December 2020, again stress the need to urgently carry out the long identified fiscal and monetary reforms as the precondition for lifting and putting the economy successfully on the path of full recovery and subsequent sustainable rapid growth.
 
One, IMF staff conducted a virtual mission from October 30 to November 17, 2020, in the context of the 2020 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria. At the end of the mission, the IMF issued a press release on December 11, 2020 which stated, among other things, that under the prevailing federal economic policies, the economic outlook was challenging. As in related press releases over at least the past four years, the Bretton Woods institution recommended “major policy adjustments” embracing unified exchange rate reforms with a market-based flexible exchange rate as a means of addressing recurrent balance of payments pressures and raising the medium term growth path. The IMF mission specifically enjoined that the operational monetary policy framework along with policy strategy and communication should be directed to establishing the primacy of price stability.
