Myanmar's army said Monday it will hold fresh elections and hand power to the winning party once a year-long state of emergency has elapsed, hours after carrying out a coup. "We will perform real multi-party democracy... with complete balance and fairness," a statement on the army's official Facebook page said. The military claims last year's election, which saw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy win in a landslide, was riddled with massive voter fraud. Unable to accept the result, the army staged a coup early Monday. The statement was issued hours after the army took power, detaining de facto leader Suu Kyi, declaring a state of emergency and appointing ex-general Myint Swe as acting president. It said that power will be transferred to the winning party after "holding a free and fair general election and the emergency provisions period is complete." According to Myanmar's constitution -- scripted by the army -- a nationwide state of emergency can be declared for up to a year. But given the coup and the army's near-total control of the country, that timeframe is within their power to change.
