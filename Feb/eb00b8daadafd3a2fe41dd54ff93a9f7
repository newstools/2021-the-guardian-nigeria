A renowned accountant and financial expert, Vera Augustine, yesterday urged Nigerian youths to engage themselves in meaningful ventures to earn a living rather than involving in getting-rich-fast through yahoo yahoo, saying that there are many ways to make money without involving in illicit business. In a statement in Abakaliki, Vela said that the syndrome had made youths to be lazy, warning that if this ugly trend is not tackled urgently, the society would be doomed. Vera, a global and astute banker, accountant and transformational leader with 20 years of technical and strategic level experience spanning across personnel consulting, banking and oil/gas sectors, said it was disheartening that some youths nowadays involved themselves in illicit activities just to make money. The financial and safety expert said there were ways to get rich without involving in criminal activities, adding that it sad that some youths, who are the future of this country, nowadays take solace in criminal activities just to make money under the guise of there is no job. “The sad truth is, among the joblessness, there are millions of jobs in Nigeria. The issue of passing through shortcuts to success is becoming the order of the day in Nigeria and it is sad. “Every day, you see on the pages of newspapers arrest and conviction of yahoo boys. Sadly, most of these guys are graduates. “So, the question is, Do they spend four years in school to end up as fraudsters? Our youths need to have a rethink. It is high time they realise the future of this country lies in this hand.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
