In a viral video, the protesters were seen detained in a black maria. “We have been arrested. Over ten of us. We are kept in a black maria stationed at the toll gate now.” one of the arrested persons said. A young man also detained in the police van said he was just there to observe before the police approached and asked him to identify himself. The 24-year-old man said he was “bundled and harassed” by the officers. He is not the only one who claimed he was arrested for no reason. Another young man who identified himself as Christopher Emmanuel Okpoji said he was passing bye and the police called him and held his shirt. Okpoji said he was “arrested for no reason.” The Nigerian Government and Police have said it would not tolerate another #Endsars protest in the country. Nigeria’s minister of information Lai Mohammed at a press conference said the government “strongly warn those who are planning to re-occupy Lekki Toll Gate on Saturday to desist.” Nigerian youths scheduled a new protest tagged #OcuupyLekkiTollgate for Saturday over the handover of the Lekki toll gate, where Nigerian forces opened fire on unarmed protesters last October, to its owners Lekki Concession Company. Members of the judicial panel set up by the Lagos State government to investigate the October 2020 Lekki shooting voted 5-4 in favor of the handover on Saturday. The youth, however, kicked against this decision by the Judicial panel to hand over the toll gate back to LCC for repairs and to begin operations without granting justice to the victims of the October 20 incidents.
