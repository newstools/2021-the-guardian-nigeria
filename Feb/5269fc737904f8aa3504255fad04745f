Liverpool tweeted a picture of their goalkeeper accompanied by the title of the club’s anthem — “You’ll Never Walk Alone”. “Liverpool FC is deeply saddened by the tragic death of Alisson Becker’s father, Jose, in Brazil on Wednesday,” said a statement from the club. “The thoughts of everybody at the club are with Alisson and the Becker family at this incredibly sad and difficult time.” Alisson’s team-mates Adrian and Virgil van Dijk both took to Instagram to express their support. David de Gea, the goalkeeper with arch-rivals Manchester United, posted a picture on Twitter of the two of them embracing after a game with the words: “We are all with you.” Brazilian club Fluminense, where Alisson’s brother Muriel currently plays, said on Twitter: “Fluminense Football Club deeply regret the passing of Jose Agostinho Becker, father of goalkeepers Muriel and Alisson. We wish all strength to his friends and family.” Liverpool’s next match is away to Sheffield United on Sunday. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
