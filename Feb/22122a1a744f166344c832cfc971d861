Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba has felicitated with the new Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Dr. (Mrs.) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, describing her emergence as a great feat that testifies to her courage, hard work, resourcefulness and diligence. In a congratulatory letter on behalf of the Church of Nigeria, the Primate said Okonjo-Iweala’s track record of achievements as Foreign Affairs Minister and a two-term Minister of Finance in the Federal Republic of Nigeria speaks volumes of her excellent performance, which is furthered by her contribution to the development and sustainability of the global economy, as evidenced in her role as a Managing Director at World Bank. The Anglican Metropolitan assured Okonjo-Iweala of the Church’s continued prayer for wisdom, grace, fear of God and excellent service delivery. The letter reads in part: “You have distinguished yourself as a good Ambassador of Nigeria, who has kept the flag of Nigeria flying high with distinction in the international community. Your eminent role as the Chair of the Board of GAVI, (Global Alliance for Vaccines and lmmunisation), and your various celebrated global recognitions, including membership of the Board of Twitter, has earned you a dignified image in the international community. “You are, indeed, a gift to Nigeria, Africa and the world. As the first African and first female Director-General of the WTO, the largest international economic organisation in the world, you have trailed the blaze in distinguished global leadership.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
