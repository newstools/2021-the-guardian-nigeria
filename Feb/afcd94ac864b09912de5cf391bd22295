Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann started with Spain’s Dani Olmo, with playmaker Emil Forsberg sidelined by a knee injury. France defender Dayot Upamecano started at centre-back after it was confirmed at the weekend that he will join Bayern Munich next season. The first-leg tie was moved from Leipzig to Budapest due to Germany’s strict Covid-19 travel restrictions, with the return leg at Anfield scheduled for March 10.
