Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, has described the allegation against him by Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, that he expended N30b on the Benin storm-water project, as false and mischievous. Agba, in a letter to the governor, said he was taken aback by Obaseki’s statement on the project. “I dare say without any fear of contradiction, that this is not only false, but also outlandishly erroneous, misleading and patently mischievous. As the then Chairman of the Edo State Economic Team, you were privy to the conception, planning, execution and expenditure on the project,” the minister claimed. He also declared that the governor could not claim to not know that only N22b was paid to the contractor for 70 percent of the project delivered before he took over as governor. “I was, therefore, surprised at your decision to call me out on the expenditure of N30b on the Benin storm-water project, knowing full well that I neither expended such money, nor did I have any mandate to authorise payments, as the funds were not domiciled in the Ministry of Environment.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
