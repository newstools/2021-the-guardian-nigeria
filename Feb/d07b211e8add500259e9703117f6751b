The team visited Canada World, Baden Baden Hotels and Suites, Elysium and Uyi Grand Event Centre, among others, to ensure that the safety protocols on COVID-19 for social gatherings were observed. Addressing newsmen after the exercise, Mr. Simeon Idoko, who led the monitoring team, said the state government remained committed to checking the spread of the pandemic. He urged residents to support the government’s efforts in curbing the spread of the virus. He said: “The decision to visit the event centres and facilities was to observe the level of compliance with the COVID-19 safety protocols. “We wanted to ensure that there was no overcrowding in enclosed areas and to also make sure there are temperature checks for those visiting the facilities. We also ensured that the people wore face masks and if there were hand washing facilities in designated areas of the facilities.” He added that the team observed commendable levels of compliance, with just a few gaps that needed to be addressed. “In other places, we observed overcrowding in enclosed places, and took the managers of the facilities to task over the lapses,” he explained. He added that the state government would continue to deploy resources to check the spread of the pandemic. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
