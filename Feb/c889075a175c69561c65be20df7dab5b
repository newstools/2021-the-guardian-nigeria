 Elderly PHOTO: Reuters  Simard disclosed this when he visited widows at Itedo in Lagos, saying: “I was impressed by my visit to Itedo area of Lekki, Lagos to familiarise with elderly women who are benefiting from ActionAid initiative to ensure economic inclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It is important to support women, especially elderly women to ensure that they have access to training and capacity building to enable them to contribute to their community and build the country’s economy. “This will also serve as an empowerment capacity for women and children so as to be in a better position to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.” Simard said the situation with vulnerable women was pathetic because they have been dying before COVID-19 and the health crisis created more economic disparity. On her part, Executive Director, Centre for Gender Economic Initiative (CGE), Uchenna Idoko, said Simard visited Lagos to inspect some of the Canadian projects, adding: “Our project was selected for inspection and we were able to tell our story of how the programme impacted the women.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
