Ifeanyi Udeze Enyimba can qualify for the quarterfinals of the CAF Confederation Cup if they plan and approach their matches well, former Super Eagles defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, has said. Enyimba is drawn in Group A alongside former African champions, Orlando Pirates of South Africa and Entente Setif of Algeria, as well as Al Ahly Benghazi of Libya. Udeze urged the Aba-based team to endeavour to win their home games and pick points outside Nigeria when the group stage begins. He also advised them to avoid complacency in their games, adding that past experience in the continent should guide them in their campaign. He, however, advised Enyimba to raise the standard of their game, saying the group phase of the competition would be tougher than what they have experienced so far. “I am not scared by the grouping of Enyimba against South African and Algeria clubs, who have won laurels in the continent before. Enyimba is also a big club in Africa, which other teams respect. “All the team needs to do is to pick vital points in every game, win their home matches and avoid unnecessary distraction that could cost them dearly in away games. “Enyimba is an experienced side in CAF tournaments and they will surely come out of the group,” he said. The group matches of the CAF Confederations Cup will start next month with two teams from each group qualifying for the quarterfinals of the championship. Enyimba is Nigeria’s sole surviving team in CAF organised tournaments this season. They beat Rivers United on Sunday in Port Harcourt to qualify for the group stage of the Confederation Cup.
