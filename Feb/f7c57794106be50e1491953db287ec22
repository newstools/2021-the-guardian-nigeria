It was a productive engagement and consensus that illegal occupants of Ondo forest reserves should vacate, put an end to night grazing and collectively fight criminals. Similar peace talks were held at the Aso Villa, with Oyo and Ondo governors and Ooni of Ife taking turns to meet with the President on security matters.  Constitutionally, all citizens of Nigeria are entitled to settle, live and move freely anywhere and everywhere in Nigeria without any fear of rejection or discrimination. However, the rights to freedom of movement and personal liberty are subject to laws which can be enacted under Section 45 of the Constitution to derogate from these rights in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health or for the purpose of protecting the rights and freedom of other persons.

And he has further support from the Ondo State Forestry Law regime (Forestry Law of Western State and National Forestry Policy, 2006).  The state government and others across the region should ensure the full implementation of this law in the interest of peace and orderliness in the region.
