 Plastic pollution… causing flooding in cities  Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, made the appeal during yesterday’s “Morning Chats on Lagos Recycle”, which was streamed live online via the Zoom app. He enlightened the audience on the recycling initiative introduced by the authority aimed at combating the challenge of plastics pollution. Odumboni noted that the authority, as part of the Lagos recycle initiative, had set up recycling centres at strategic locations in the state, with the vision to have a recycling centre per local council, which would serve as collation centres for recyclables, thus ensuring the minimisation of wastes that end up at the dumpsites.
