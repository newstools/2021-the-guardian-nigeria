The CBN had last Friday issued a directive to deposit money banks (DMBs), non-financial banks and other financial institutions not to provide banking services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.  President of Stakeholders in Blockchain Association of Nigeria (SiBAN), Mr. Senator Ihenyan, said it has made efforts since 2017 to engage the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to regulate the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria to no avail. 
   
According to him, regulation is the approach the developed countries have taken. The United State currency regulator recently allowed banks to trade in stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their market value to some external reference like the US dollar.
