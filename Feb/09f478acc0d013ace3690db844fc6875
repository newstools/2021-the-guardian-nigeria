 Hope Uzodimma  The councils, according to a statement issued by the stateâ€™s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, are Orlu, Orsu, Oru East and Njaba. After a serious clash about two weeks ago between the military and members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), said to have been formed by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), resulting in loss of lives and destruction of property, Uzodimma, in a statewide broadcast, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew (6:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m.) in 10 out of the 12 local councils in Orlu zone (Imo West Senatorial District), comprising Oru West, Ideato North, Ideato South, Nkwerre, Isu and Nwangele, Orlu, Oru East, Orsu, and Njaba local councils. Following information about the dehumanising cases allegedly perpetrated by the military against the residents of the area, the governor last weekend relaxed the curfew in the first six councils (Oru West, Ideato North, Ideato South, Nkwerre, Isu and Nwangele), remaining four, which he yesterday relaxed. The Guardian gathered that the governor was unhappy that a monarch of one of the affected communities in the councils, Eze Ben Okeke, was frog-jumped by some soldiers at a checkpoint when he was going on an official traditional duty. Even his identification could not save him. His subjects later protested the action and urged the governor to fish out the soldiers who debased the throne.
