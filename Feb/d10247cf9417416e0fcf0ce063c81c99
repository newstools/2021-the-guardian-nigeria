But luck smiled on the Afro-pop singer after completing his secondary school education when he met a Good Samaritan. A student of Public Administration at the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, Blaqboiks is currently one of fast rising Nigerian artistes after releasing Shime, a love song inspired by his girlfriend Nimi. Speaking on his music career, the 23-year-old former bartender said, “I started fully when I finished my secondary school; that was in 2015. But I needed to get myself involved in something to fend for myself. I got a job as a barman in a hotel; I served drinks, cleaned the bar and the hotel rooms. I was always there round the clock and I only have my off day once a week and that’s every Wednesday, and I must be back at work by 8.0a.m the next day. So, it was a big challenge for me.” On how his life turned around, he narrated, “on a fateful day, the cousin of my boss who is also a friend to the owner of Benzy Records, visited the hotel and he watched me entertain guests as usual. He came another time and listened to my song being played; he asked about the artiste that sang the song and I told him I was the one. He asked what I was doing in the hotel when I was supposed be facing my music. We exchanged contacts and he sent me the number of the boss of the record label. He continued: “I chatted with him and he asked me to send him my songs which I did and from there. I have done a couple songs since I joined the record label. I have done Shakara, Mariana, Nkwobi and Revolution, which I did during the End Sars, VSOP Very Special and the recently dropped Shime.” As for his inspiration, he said, “the artiste that inspires me in Nigeria is Kizz Daniel, because of his kind of music; you can’t listen to his songs and hiss. I like Mayokun and to crown it, I like Davido.” Speaking on artistes he wishes to collaborate with, he said, “number five would be Zinoleesky, while Mayokun will be in number 4. Kizz Daniel will be the third person, Bella Shmurda will be number two, while Davido is the number 1. “I do Afro-pop, but I listen to all the genres of music, including Fuji. But what made me focus more on Afro-pop is because of the sound; I also write my songs,” he hinted. The singer added, “Background matters a lot to whatever anyone does or is doing. I will not do vulgar song because of my person and my background. I know if my mum should listen to it, she won’t find it funny. I know the Nigerian music industry is flooded with talents, but my uniqueness will pave the way for me to the top. I create my own style, which is enough to see me at the top.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
