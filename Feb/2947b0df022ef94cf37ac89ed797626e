Elon Musk | Image: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images News/Getty Images Tech billionaire Elon Musk announced on Tuesday that he was taking a break from Twitter “for a while”. This is coming after the Tesla CEO’s posts on the platform helped fuel a stock market frenzy that sent the share prices of several companies soaring. Musk overtook Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to become the world’s wealthiest person last month, with a fortune estimated at $185 billion following a nine-fold surge in Tesla’s share price over the past year. “Off Twitter for a while,” the Tesla and SpaceX founder told his 44.5 million followers on the platform, not giving a reason for his decision. He tweeted last week in support of a group of retail investors on website Reddit who had coordinated to buy shares in Gamestop, a struggling games company, pushing the chain’s share price up by more than 680%, according to CNN. A post hours later about his love for the retail website Etsy, too, pushed the company’s share price up by as much as 8%, CNBC reported. The tweets were not the only time Musk moved markets on the platform in recent weeks. When he changed his Twitter profile to read simply “#bitcoin” last Friday, the cryptocurrency’s price temporarily skyrocketed by around 20 per cent. Musk later posted a tweet saying: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” On January 13, shares of Bandai Namco, a Japanese video game maker, jumped 4% after Musk tweeted a meme that included a character from one of its games. “Hey you … Yeah you Queen … You’re gonna make it!” he tweeted, adding heart emojis. His presence on the website has caused him legal issues in the past, however. Musk was forced to step down as chairman of the Tesla’s board in 2018 after a serious run-in with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of misleading investors by tweeting about a possible withdrawal of Tesla from the stock exchange. Musk’s announcement has elicited various reactions, mostly jokes based on his recent tweets with some even joking about the value of Twitter falling: Watch the entire stock market stabilise all of a sudden  https://t.co/wkTxq25iGR — Michael Ross (@newmichaelross) February 2, 2021  Stock market after this tweet#ElonMusk #StockMarket https://t.co/c4NHleWlgq pic.twitter.com/DimWbuuOpc — Mr. Garad (@sumeet_garad) February 2, 2021  [furiously researches how to purchase stock in something called “Off Twitter for awhile”] https://t.co/qDordLYPmn — DimetapBordeauxchambord (@DavidBowiesCock) February 2, 2021  You fight with Jack?
