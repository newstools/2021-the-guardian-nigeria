   The human rights organisation lamented that despite an ex-parte order by the Federal High Court in Abuja, the agency went ahead to seize the properties, which include their residence and hotel at Omole Estate, Lagos, as well as surrounded the properties with eight armed security guards. Speaking at a briefing held yesterday, the Chairman, CLO, Comrade Kenny Bakare, said AMCON’s refusal to obey court orders and the use of armed security guards to scare Oreye and his family were a threat to their fundamental human rights and amounted to court contempt. He said despite all the fundamental flaws, AMCON had continued to humiliate and traumatise Oreye and his family by locking up the gates of their business and place of residence with signage boldly written “POSSESSION TAKEN TODAY 24-07-2020 BY COURT ORDER SUIT NO. FHC/ABI/156/2020 IN RECEIVERSHIP BY AMCON” on the gates and walls. Bakare said the human rights organisation had carefully gone through relevant documents on the debt matter brought to its office, on how Oreye borrowed N178 million through his companies, Peace Global and Peace Hotels Limited, in 2004 to fund a telecoms investment, which was destroyed by a thunderstorm, after which he repaid N162 million, with N16 million balance on principal, a development that made WEMA Bank attempt selling the collateral used to secure the loan.
