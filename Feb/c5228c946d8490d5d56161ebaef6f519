   The extension was announced to journalists on Thursday by Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammad Dingyadi at the presidential villa, Abuja. He said the extension was necessary to give room for the proper selection of a successor. “Mr President has decided that the present IGP, Mohammed Adamu, will continue to serve as the IG for the next three months, to allow for a robust and efficient process of appointing a new IG,” Dingyadi said. “This is not unconnected to the desire of Mr President to, not only have a smooth handover, but to also ensure that the right officer is appointed into that position. “Mr President is extending by three months to allow him get into the process of allowing a new one.” The minister dismissed insinuations that the extension had brought anout a lacuna in the whole scenario, adding that it was within the President’s constitutional powers. “There’s no lacuna. Mr President can decide to extend his tenure for three months,” Dingyadi said. He said the story making the round earlier of the IGP’s retirement from service was false.
