Yul Edochie, 39, who is also a Nollywood star, shared a video on his social media pages on Thursday night with the caption: “My Father Chief Pete Edochie endorses my 2023 Presidential ambition. God Almighty, take absolute control.” In the video, Pete Edochie first admitted that although he is not the type to involve himself in politics, he, however, was supporting his son’s political ambition after constant pleadings from young people to publicly endorse Yul. “My values are very strong. I have my own children and they are very strong in that regard too and I am not one to be involved in politics. But you see, not all your children are bound to follow you, one of my sons, who incidentally is an actor, has decided that he wants to be a politician. He continued: “Most of the youngsters have been bugging my phone, asking me to endorse my son that they want him as president and l get amused. But they keep insisting daddy, we want Yul to be the president of this country. ‘We like him.'” The septuagenarian also expressed confidence and belief that his son possesses the right values and drive to steer the country forward. “He is disciplined, sympathetic, he believes a lot in people. They have bothered me so much that today, I hereby present him to you. He has my blessing and endorsement, any day he decides to veer off from the discipline under which he was raised, l will withdraw my support him. It shall be well with you, son,” he prayed for him. My Father Chief Pete Edochie endorses my 2023 Presidential ambition.
