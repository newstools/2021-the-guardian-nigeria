The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said on Thursday Faisal Maina, son of Abdulrasheed Maina, former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), has fled to the United States. EFCC’s prosecuting counsel Mohammed Abubakar made the disclosure at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Faisal Maina is being prosecuted on three counts of money laundering. Abubakar said EFCC got information that Faisal sneaked to the U.S through the Republic of Niger. The trial judge, Okon Abang, had ordered Faisal’s surety, Sani Dan-Galadima, who is a member of the House of Representatives to forfeit a property used as a bail bond. Dan-Galadima, who represents Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara, had entered into a N60 million bail bond on behalf of Faisal. Faisal’s father Maina is also being prosecuted for separate charges of money laundering at the court. He jumped bail last year but was rearrested in Niger Republic. A court is still hearing his bail application on medical grounds. Opposing Maina’s bail application, the EFCC had told the court that the defendant has multiple citizenship and was trying to obtain a fresh passport to flee to the United States when he was arrested in Niger Republic. EFCC is prosecuting Maina for alleged money laundering to the tune of N2billion. Maina is facing a 12-count money laundering charge levelled against him and a firm by the EFCC. EFCC alleged that Maina, as Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, used the account of the firm for money laundering to the tune of about N2 billion, part of which he used to acquire landed properties in Abuja.
