Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, yesterday, applauded Nigerians for their condolences and show of love over the death of his father, Sir Arthur Okorie Okowa. In a statement he personally issued, he thanked all those who condoled with him and those who called or sent messages of condolences to him and his siblings. He said due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the family had resolved to hold a private funeral for their late patriarch sometime this month, adding that a ‘celebration of life’ event would be held in his honour in August subject to decline of the pandemic. He described the deceased as a “huge pillar of support,” saying he would greatly miss his father’s wise counsel. “On behalf of the Okowa family of Owa-Alero, Ika North East Council, I wish to thank all who have taken time to commiserate with us on the death of my beloved father. “Ever since the news of his demise, our family has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of goodwill from a wide spectrum of political, business, religious leaders and all Nigerians. “My siblings and I are deeply grateful for the show of solidarity, which have, in no small measure, helped us to cope with Papa’s passing. Although he died at what may be considered a good old age, the death of someone so dear cannot but leave one with a sense of void. “My late father was a strong pillar of support all through my political and public service career. I drew immeasurably from his fountain of knowledge and wisdom, and he was very passionate about the growth and development of our beloved Delta State. “Once again, I thank all those who have called, visited, prayed for us and issued statements in solidarity with our family. May God richly bless you,” Governor Okowa added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
