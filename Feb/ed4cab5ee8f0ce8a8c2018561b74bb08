Vice President of Nigeria Kickboxing Federation, Gospel Obolo, has called on Federal, State government and private sectors to invest in sports, by providing state-of-the-act facilities to enhance effective performance of athletes. Speaking on the standard of sports in the country, Obolo noted that lack of quality sporting facilities was one of the problems affecting the growth of Nigerian sports. He said that if athletes were exposed to sophisticated equipment, they would be able to compete favourably with their counterparts abroad and learn more on modern tactics to execute their skills. The Bayelsa State-born sports administrator also said that providing quality sports facilities would enhance the performance of the country’s athletes and put them in high spirit to showcase their talents at any level of competition. Obolo, a businessman, disclosed that last year he opened entertainment centre called Renew Empire Sports Tourism and Entertainment centre in Nigeria. He noted that as part of the firm’s effort to provide quality sporting facilities in the country, it built a high performance sports centre, which has space for boxing, karate, taekwondo, judo, kickboxing, wrestling, swimming and shooting close to the Federal University Otuoke, Ogbia in Bayelsa State to aid in discovering of talented athletes for the country. Obolo, who also double as chairman of the Bayelsa, Kickboxing Association, stated that the centre would give the athletes a better platform to compete favourably at major competitions. On the plan for the year, Obolo said the Federation would start with a mini contest this month in a yet to be named venue. He added that plans were ongoing to organise a grassroots football championship soon to discover talented players, who will gain scholarship in the football academy.
