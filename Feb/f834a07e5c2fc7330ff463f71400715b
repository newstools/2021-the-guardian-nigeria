According to the management of TEC, equally important, interested Nigerians, who desire to get their hands on the amazing devices without burning a hole in their pockets have been offered a flexible way of acquiring them and paying later within six months, with the added incentive of not having to pay any interest. The offer, exclusive only to the Tech Experience Centre, is valid until February 11, 2021.  Since we rolled out this offer, we have recorded significant uptake from many interested subscribers who are keen to take advantage of the zero-interest financing opportunity to get the Samsung Galaxy S21 devices,’’ she stated.
