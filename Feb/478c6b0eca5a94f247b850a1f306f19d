From 5 – 7 March 2021, leading manufacturer of home appliances, Defy (www.Defy.co.za), will be hosting the Hack The Normal (https://HackTheNormal.com) online hackathon with the aim of exploring how technology can be leveraged for sustainable living and economic development in Africa.  Supported by Defy sister company, Beko (www.Beko.com), hackathon participants will have the opportunity to develop new products, services, and business models with commercialisation potential to address one of the following challenge areas: Over the three-day hackathon, participants will be trained in a myriad of areas ranging from problem discovery and solution development, to prototyping and storytelling. Plus, they will get the chance to refine their ideas with the help of expert coaches and mentors from the fields of business, technology, and design. Projects that meet Defy’s impact, applicability and commercialisation criteria will be selected for further development. Not only will those behind the projects gain access to sales opportunities, investment networks, and the ecosystem in general – they will also have the opportunity to participate in acceleration and incubation programmes. Applications close on 28 February 2021 and will be accepted from both individuals and teams that have ideas or projects which address the hackathon’s challenges. Following a pre-evaluation process, successful participants will be notified by 3 March via email. “We invite people from across multiple disciplines to come together to innovate new solutions to ensure a sustainable life in Africa, stimulate economic growth and improve the state of our world,” concludes CEO of Defy Appliances Evren Albaş.
