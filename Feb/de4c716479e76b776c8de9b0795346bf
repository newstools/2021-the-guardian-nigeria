 Real Estate word on newspaper. Photo: MAGICBRICKS  Real estate and property firm, Sort After Project and Services Limited, has called on the Federal Government to sanitise the real estate sector, while urging the judiciary to be honest in passing verdicts on property. Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Sort After Project and Services, Moses Taiwo, stated this at the unveiling of creative entrepreneur and actor, Jide Awobona, as the firm’s brand ambassador. He described Awobona as a brand with integrity and clean record in the film industry. The company parades itself with integrity and honesty, hence it chose Awobona as ambassador for growth of the organisation, he added. “When somebody comes to claim a land that I have aquired and I take the person to court, I hope the court will do their due diligence before they pass the verdict, and if the verdict did not go well due to exchange of money, that is bad,” he said. He urged those investing in land business to always carry out investigations before committing their monies to avoid being duped. In his remarks, Awobona promised to put in his best for the organisation’s growth and success. “I am all about growth and success in all ramifications. When I partner with any brand, my first priority is the success and growth of the brand. My vision and long term goal is for the firm to compete with high-ranking top companies in Nigeria and globally. “For my being an ambassador, money is not the priority; the success and growth of the brand should be priority. That is why money for me is secondary,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
