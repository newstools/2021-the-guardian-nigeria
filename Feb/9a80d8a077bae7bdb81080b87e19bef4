They say the reward for hard work is more work. That sums up the thinking at the Ibori Golf and Country Club, Asaba, where members have chosen to re-elect the club captain, Alfred Ebreneyin, for a second term. Acknowledged as an innovator and crowd puller, Ebreneyin was first elected into the position in 2020. But his performance in a year dogged by the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted all sporting activities globally, made the members to decide to entrust him with their affairs once again. And he has pledged to meet their expectations of his executive once again. Also re-elected in the 2021 new administrative year are some of his former executive members. They include Jimmy Odogwu (Vice Captain), Chuks Nwani (House officer), Gibson Lee (Course Officer), and Tam Brisbie (Handicap Secretary). Former Lady Vice Captain, Mrs. Hetty Egbai, is now the captain of the Ladies Division, while Queen Mowah will serve as Lady Vice-Captain, just as Henry Onianwa is the new Competition Secretary. Speaking after his swearing in, Ebreneyin thanked the club for the confidence reposed in him and other executive members and pledged the new executive will not disappoint them. On his agenda for the second term, he said: “The club will consolidate on the gains so far and put in place structures to ensure the sustainable development of the club. “Some of the key projects this administration will embark upon include branding opportunities for strategic partners, Pro- Am golf tournament and developmental programmes for young aspiring golfers. “The legacy I want to leave behind is to have a viable club with structures to ensure its sustainability. “We will work harder to seek tournament packages that will attract more golfers from across the country to our club, and to further improve the aesthetics of our golf course. “Ibori golf course is very fantastic in a great location, a growing membership, excellent facilities, and a great community who come together to play golf. We will do our best to organise grassroots development programmes and embark on more membership drive this year.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
