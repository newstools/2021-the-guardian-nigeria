 Rivers United in a recent match of the NPFL… the team will meet Akwa United in today’s Match day 13 fixture  Eguma, who said the ‘Pride of Rivers’ need to do more in order to achieve results in away fixtures, having won just one and four defeats out of their five away matches so far this season. Having exited the CAF Confederation Cup competition on penalties to Enyimba FC, coupled with their poor away form in the NPFL, Coach Eguma says his team can now shift their focus to the league and make a point, as the Port Harcourt-based team visits the ‘Promise Keepers’ at the Nest of Champions Stadium in Uyo today. “Rivers United players are professionals and we have to still psyche them up. We entered for these competitions and I think it’s not yet over. Things have not gone out of hand. We can still pick our pieces together and face the league. “The players have to brace up for the NPFL challenges. Being out of the continental games is not the end of life. If you do well in the league, you can also pick another ticket on the continent again. “We will try to psyche the players up for them to get better in the NPFL. They need to win their games for the team to come back to life and move up in the league,” he said The most recent loss suffered by Rivers United came in the hands of Warri Wolves and they are seventh on the log.
