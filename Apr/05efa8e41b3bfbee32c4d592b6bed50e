Meanwhile, the NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo), the independent regulatory arm of Nigerian Exchange Group, has published its supervision priorities for 2021. According to the exchange, the supervision priorities provide guidance to Trading License Holders (TLHs) of the exchange, the investing public, and other stakeholders to ensure a fair and orderly market and are underpinned by business practices considered to be of market wide interest. According to the Chief Executive Officer, NGX RegCo, Ms. Tinuade Awe, “the priority document provides an insight into the performance of TLHs with regards to previous areas of regulatory concerns and observed emerging trends. Some of these include the increased dependence of TLHs on virtual communication and trading channels occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as new market trends as it relates to new laws, regulation, and rules. “Our supervisory programs have, therefore, been re-evaluated to introduce various initiatives designed to deal with the present challenges, including issuing statements, developing dialogue platforms for regulatory updates and providing assistance through regulatory arrangements that seek to cushion the ﬁnancial and operational effects of regulatory activity on the businesses of our stakeholders as appropriate”.
