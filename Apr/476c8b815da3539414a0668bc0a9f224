A new Sheriff is in town. There is a change of guard within the Nigeria Police amidst increasing insecurity in the country underlined by a takeover of virtually all parts of the country by new militarism, that is, non-state actors, challenging the country’s sovereignty. Mr. Mohammed Adamu, until the change, was the Inspector General of Police (IGP). He has been replaced by Mr. Alkali Baba, Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIGP) in an acting capacity. 
  
It would be recalled that the former IGP who was due for retirement last February had his tenure extended with arguments that appointment was at the pleasure of the president and could extend the tenure of an appointee when so inclined. This logic was put forward as a result of the discountenance of the public over the extension of the tenure of the former IGP despite clearly spelt out succession process within the police formation. Citizens went to great length in seeking a judicial review for due process to be followed. The elongation of his tenure was more exasperating to the public on account of the worsening insecurity situation in the country that had engendered a massive nationwide protest against the police formation under the (hashtag) #EndSARS. Worse still was his handling of the aftermath. The so-called disbandment of the Special Anti-robbery Squad and its replacement with SWATT was seen as a shoddy job with the SARs structure still in place. Indeed, in a saner environment, it would have led to a voluntary step-down by the police presiding officer. The medium was against the extension of his tenure by some three months. His sack was therefore overdue.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
