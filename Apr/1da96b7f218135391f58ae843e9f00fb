 Petroleum Industry Bill  There are a few other issues in the Bill that deserve serious scrutiny, including the proposed commercialisation of the NNPC. While the commercialisation of the perennially loss-making corporation is desirable and overdue, the process must be done in a way that does not transfer all juicy assets to a private company and leave the government with legacy liabilities of the NNPC.  The current provisions on this must be vetted to forestall this.  The PIB is an important bill that could be used to do great things for the country, but we must resist the urge to use it to retain old problems or create new ones. We have an opportunity to ensure the proposed law is designed to work for the Nigerian people and not for a select few who profit from proliferation of agencies and government interventions. I will end this piece by encouraging more Nigerians from all walks of life to take a more active role in lawmaking, especially when it concerns crucial Bills like this. It is our collective duty, not just the job of our paid lawmakers, to make sure our interests are protected always. We -the citizens- have in the past made a mistake of not scrutinising a bill properly until it has been passed into law, and by then it is almost always too late. We can’t afford that mistake with the PIB.
