Aspira Nigeria Limited is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of personal health care and laundry products in Nigeria. Located in the Northern commercial city of Kano, Aspira Nigeria Ltd. began operations in 2009, with the production of various detergents and soaps. Today, it has expanded to 12 manufacturing facilities and their products are distributed across Nigeria. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the brand decided to develop a detergent that could reduce the risk of spreading illness-causing viruses in addition to keeping clothes stain-free, in addition to their Viva Detergent packs. That initiative gave birth to Viva Plus Laundry Sanitizer, Nigeria’s leading detergent and multi-purpose soap, which was developed under multi-enzyme and eco-friendly technologies and contains zero percent bleach. It is gentle on fabrics and works even in cold water.
