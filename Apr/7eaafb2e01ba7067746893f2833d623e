 Shodeinde  The scripture tells us of how our Lord in His usual magnanimous nature came to the aid of His children. Then the Lord required sacrifice, the shedding of blood without which redemption is not complete, but once again, our Lord, in His compassionate disposition, made it easy for us, by taking the hardest route ever. He displayed an act of love never seen nor to be rivaled in the history of creation, by sending His only Son, Jesus Christ to die on the cross. The blood of Jesus immediately negated and nullified the effect of the blood of animals or the worshipping of any idols. The blood of Jesus became our ransom. Hence, the name ‘Feast of Jesus Passover.’ In essence, it is the celebration of the blood of our Lord Jesus.
