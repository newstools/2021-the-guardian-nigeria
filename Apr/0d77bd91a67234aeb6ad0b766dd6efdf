According to the state Commander of the NDLEA, Peter Odaudu, the claim by the 38-year-old suspect to being a senior official of the Sokoto State Command of a law enforcement agency was still being investigated. During interrogation, the suspect confessed to trafficking drugs three times in the past from Benin Republic for a notorious dealer known as Queen. Meanwhile, attempts by another trafficker to smuggle 2,800 bottles of diverse cough syrups into Abuja have been thwarted by operatives of the NDLEA in Suleja, Niger State, where they recovered 1,020 bottles of CS cough syrup with codeine, 390 bottles of CSP cough syrup with codeine and 1,390 bottles of barcadin cough syrup with codeine. The Commander, Niger State Command of the agency, Haruna Kwetishe, said the illicit substances meant for drug joints in Abuja were procured from Onitsha, Anambra State and diverted to Morada market motor park in Suleja to avoid security scrutiny in Abuja.
