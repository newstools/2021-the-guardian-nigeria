He revealed that, as at the third quarter of 2017, more than half of Nigeria’s nearly 185-million population was under 30, with youth unemployment standing at 33.10 per cent. Regretting that a large number of graduates churned out yearly by the institutions of higher learning lacked employability skills, Wahab explained that the need to bridge the gap, so as to reduce the growing rate of the unemployment rate and its attendant consequences was one of the reasons the state has not relented in building capacity and committing resources to skills acquisition and vocational development.
