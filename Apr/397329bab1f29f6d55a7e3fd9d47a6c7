The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, will, tomorrow, host this year’s World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr. Lanre Mojola, who disclosed this in a pre-event programme, said the theme for this year’s World Day for Safety and Health at work would be ‘Anticipate, Prepare and Respond to Crises – Invest Now in Resilient Occupational Safety and Health Systems.’ Mojola maintained that the COVID-19 pandemic had led governments, employers, workers and the general populace to face unprecedented challenges in relation to the virus and the many effects it has had on the world of work. He added that this year’s celebration would focus on strategies to strengthen national Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) systems to build resilience in order to face crises now and in the future. He urged full participation of all stakeholders in the elaborate safety roadmap of the post-pandemic era as far as safety and health of all Lagosians are concerned.
