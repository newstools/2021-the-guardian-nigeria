The Kremlin denies the allegation. He is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges — which he says are politically motivated — in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow. The 44-year-old began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands. On Saturday, several doctors close to Navalny warned that his health had rapidly deteriorated and he could “die any minute,” demanding prison officials grant them immediate access. “There is truly an authoritarian drift in Russia,” Le Drian said. “Russia is responsible for Navalny’s health, it must assume its role,” he added, saying the European Union was closely following his fate. “We have already taken action,” he said, referring to EU sanctions. “The package of sanctions is already significant, but there may be others.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
