The roads are Adeniji Adele and Oke Popo/Tapa Streets. Adeniji Adele road is presently a two-lane single carriageway of about 2.234kilometer while Oke Popo/ Tapa Streets is about 1.069km.  “It will also enhance property values, stimulate businesses and economic development among the people of Lagos Island “The road construction will no doubt help to improve road connectivity within the axis, unlock perennial traffic gridlock with resultant reduction in travel time along the corridor,” he added. 
 
Earlier, Permanent Secretary, Office of Infrastructure, Rotimi Thomas, said the road projects, which were 2.234 kilometres and 1.6 kilometres will bring about socio-economic growth, enhance infrastructural development as well as create employment for residents. He urged support for the government in its efforts to build a greater Lagos. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
