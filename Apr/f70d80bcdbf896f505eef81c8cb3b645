The event was with sponsorship from “Diageo, Johnnie Walker, The World’s No. 1 Scotch Whisky” and “My Girlfriend’s Closet, A High Luxury Consignment Store at Ikoyi, Lagos”. Speaking at the Art Exhibition, Osora Moje shared with us how we felt to finally have his work out of the studio and onto the walls of his first show. L-R Ngozi Nkwoji , Osora Mojekwu, Nwando Ajene, and Uzoma Okoli “I couldn’t be more glad to finally share with everyone the work that I’d been creating over the last 12 months. What is seen on these walls are truly a demonstration of my innermost thoughts and to have them out in the open is one of the most scary, yet fulfilling things I get to experience as a new artist.” The solo art exhibition was attended by many individuals who have a love for art and culture. Attendees like Uzoma Okoli, Executive Director of Emzor Pharmaceutical; Nwando Ajene, Marketing Manager Nestle; Uche Ajene, MD, Stephanie John, and My Girlfriend’s Closet; Ladi Balogun, CEO of FCMB Group Plc; Denola Grey, Actor and Fashion Consultant; Amaechi Okobi, Group Head, Communications & External Affairs at Access Bank Plc and among many others were present at the exhibition.
