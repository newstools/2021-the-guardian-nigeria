Technology helped to maintain social and emotional well-being and helped many organisations stay afloat. However, this new reality has also led to an increase in the number of cyber-attacks. As cyber-attacks increase and new cybersecurity trends continue to emerge, organisations must take a proactive IT security stance to keep their operations safe. They must become more agile, flexible, and collaborative as they strive to protect their critical assets and infrastructure. They need to increase their digital security initiatives, change strategies, and educate employees about cybersecurity to deal with this increase in cyber-threats. The year came with an optimistic outlook considering the current strides in developing vaccines for COVID-19.   As businesses seek to transition to a new normal in 2021, we will examine some of the projections and expectations in the cybersecurity landscape and what will underpin organisations’ cybersecurity priorities in 2021.  The mechanism for providing spontaneous response and data-driven insights rests on technology. These technologies, including automated security tools and advanced machine learning technologies, support decision making and provide alerts on risky thresholds in tackling threats and vulnerabilities. In 2021 the use of these technology-driven security tools will be at the centre of cybersecurity implementation.
 
With growing data privacy awareness and the adoption of the GDPR globally come greater scrutiny from clients and consumers, who demand their sensitive information be kept safe. Legacy technologies built on static rules can simply not stand up to this pressure, and we are instead going to see even greater adoption of intelligent security technologies that use contextual machine learning to keep data safe. Organisations will need to make conscious efforts to create security strategies and implement the same with intelligent technology-driven security tools and advanced machine learning technologies. 5. There will be an increase in Ransomware attacks COVID-19 brought some social challenges, including latent economic exposures across the globe. Individuals who hitherto were dedicated to specific employment relinquished these jobs or earned less than required. Of course, this increased the number of cybercriminals who attack databases and block user accesses to demand ransoms before providing access to legitimate users. These ransomware attackers will be targeting corporate entities, holding the company’s databases in exchange for crypto-currency or other forms of financial compensation.
 
The greatest challenge with ransomware attacks is the reputational dent on the organisation and the transit data accumulated by the attackers. Even when the accesses are restored, the attackers can still use the retained data to blackmail the organisation, make financial demands and publicly expose the organisation. Ransomware is becoming more technically advanced and sophisticated. In 2021, ransomware attacks will be the most rampant attack across organisations. Several entities will be targeted and compromised. Organisations, therefore, must prepare for ransomware prevention and recovery. To be continued tomorrow. Ikegwu wrote from Lagos.
