Photo; TWITTER/GOVERNOROBASEKI  Obaseki had said during the state transition committee stakeholders’ engagement meeting at the Government House, Benin City at the weekend that Nigeria was currently over burdened by external borrowings. He alleged that the Federal Government printed about N60b to augment allocation to states in March, adding that by December 2021, the country’s total borrowings would be in excess of between N15tr to N16tr. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had reportedly denied knowledge of the claim that Nigeria printed billions of naira last month to cushion its financial burden. However, reacting to the claims, state Chairman of APC, Col. David Imuse (rtd.), described Obaseki’s comments as ‘spurious, alarmist, untrue and wicked.’ In a statement issued by the Assistant Publicity Secretary, Victor Osehobo, the party urged Governor Obaseki to use the National Economic Council, the Nigerian Governors Forum, and the Nigerian Economic Summit to offer useful ideas. BESIDES, the Edo State House of Assembly has cleared 15 nominees as Special Advisers (SAs) to the governor. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Osarodion Ogie, conveyed Obaseki’s request for the approval of the appointment to the House Majority Leader of the House, Henry Okhuarobo, urged members to approve the governor’s request, adding that it was the first step to constituting the state’s executive council. Speaker of the House, Marcus Onobun, directed the Clerk of the Assembly, Yahaya Omogbai, to convey copies of the approval to the governor for immediate action.
