Ishaku The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would have planted a one-party system in Nigeria in 2019 if not for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State who foiled the plot, Taraba State Governor, Darius Dickson Ishaku, said at the weekend in Asaba. Speaking while commissioning the newly constructed Jesus Saves/Agric road and Okpanam-Asaba road, all in Asaba, the state capital, Ishaku stated that Okowa saved the country from the mess the APC government was about to plough the country into. He, therefore, applauded Okowa for a job well done, adding: “Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will eternally be grateful to him (Okowa) for delivering on a convention that was adjudged as the best since the advent of democracy in 1999.” Ishaku, who described his Delta State counterpart as God sent, said Okowa has demonstrated that he was a master-strategist. “Okowa saved Nigeria in 2019 from becoming a one-party state. You could have imagined what Nigeria would have become by now. He led the PDP committee that produced the first adjudged presidential convention in Nigeria at Port Harcourt. “I strongly join my voice with all those that have thrown their weight behind his competence, integrity of purpose and commitment to duty. With these projects, he has turned every locality in the state to a community of beneficiaries,” Ishaku added. On his part, Okowa said the two commissioned projects were among the series of quality roads his administration has constructed. He said with the underground sewages underneath the two roads, the perennial flooding within Asaba metropolis would be a thing of the past, noting that he had closed his eyes to the antics of detractors so as to deliver on the SMART agenda of his administration.
