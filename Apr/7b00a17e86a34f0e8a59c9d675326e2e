A non-profit organisation, Outstanding Women Awards, has called on the Federal Government to prioritise developmental efforts with a focus on youths to reduce the high level of insecurity.
  
The Chief Executive Officer, Outstanding Women Awards, Success Abu-Idris, stated that issues of banditry, kidnapping and the state of insecurity in the nation were due to the neglect of the youths in the society, noting that more needed to be done to engage the Nigerian youths for nation-building.  Looking at the nation, everybody looks confused, but complaining is not the way forward. Some people are doing well in building the nation and this is why we are appreciating them with this award while we speak on nation-building.”
  
In her remarks, the Commissioner for Arts and Tourism, Lagos State, Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, said that the state was working hard to domesticate tourism to save the nation’s huge foreign exchange spent on foreign trips yearly.
  
Akinbile-Yusuf, who said the state would be unveiling its tourism master plan soon, added that the state was also working relentlessly to provide a conducive environment for both local and foreign investments. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
