 Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike  The apex socio-cultural organisation in Ogoni, KAGOTE, said for the sake of political equity, the Ogoni people should be given a chance this time. He lamented that no person from Ogoni has governed the state since its inception. President of KAGOTE, Emmanuel Deeyah, in a statement signed by the Acting Publicity Secretary of the organization, Mr. Obele Chu, explained that the move would enhance equity and political justice in favour of Ogoni. Deeyah was reacting to a recent comment by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, which urged everyone to come together and work to have a riverine governor in 2023. The President of Ogoni Apex group said the statement was vexatious, premature, undemocratic, and not in the interest of political justice. Deeyah emphasised that since the creation of the state, Ogoni has not produced a governor despite its huge contributions to the economic and political development of the country at large. He said: “It will be best and more suitable if a level playing field is provided for all aspirants and their fate decided at the party primaries rather than this outright blanket decree banning them from the contest. “Ogoni is yet to produce sensitive political leadership such as governor, deputy governor, speaker of the state, since the creation of Rivers State 54 years ago. “Ogoni, as an ethnic nationality in the state was at the forefront of agitation for the creation of Rivers State, alongside other ethnic nationalities and should be given the opportunity to contest the governorship in a fair contest in party primaries without being denied their rights of participation.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
