The palace of the traditional ruler of Ifitedunu, in Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State, Dr. Emeka Iluno, was set ablaze by unknown persons in the early hours of Monday. An eyewitness, who spoke in confidence, said the arson caused some damage to the monarchs’ property, including his official vehicle, while two persons sustained injury and were receiving treatment in a hospital. He also said the fire was put out by the combined efforts of good-spirited individuals around the area. The monarch, who spoke to newsmen yesterday, confirmed the incident but blamed those he called ‘men of sudden wealth’ in his community for the burning of his palace and his official SUV car. He said that there had been a crisis in his community in the past six years, but thanked God for saving his life. “My palace was set ablaze in the early hours of today. My jeep was also burnt. For the past six years, my community has been enmeshed in crisis. Some nouveau riches in my community want to take over the throne and leadership of the community,” he said. Meanwhile, Anambra State Police Command confirmed the incident in a statement on Monday, saying Dr. Ilouno’s palace was set ablaze by yet to be unidentified persons. Anambra State police spokesman, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, said the command had launched an investigation into the attack with the aim of identifying the culprits.

He said, “The Commissioner of Police in Anambra State, Mr Monday Bala Kuryas, has ordered an investigation into the attack of the palace of Igwe Ifitedunu, HRH Dr Emeka Ilouno. “Information so far available to the police reveals that two persons sustained burns and are currently receiving treatment in a hospital.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
