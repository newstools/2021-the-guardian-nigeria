You can see that the people are fed up,’’ he said. Ortom urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address security issues in the currently with renewed vigour. He also called on other governors to rise and impress on the president then need to address the nation on incessant security challenges. “This (attack) is not acceptable; this cannot continue. “My colleagues, the governors must rise and impress on the president to call a national security summit. “If possible, he should declare a state of emergency on security so that all hands will be on deck to address the situation,’’ Ortom said.
