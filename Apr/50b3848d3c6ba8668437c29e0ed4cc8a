Team Lagos gold medalist in Taekwondo, Abdulateef Arinola, has expressed appreciation to the Lagos State Sports Commission for rewarding him after winning the gold medal for the state at the ongoing National Sports Festival. Arinola beat Aliyu Salisu from Yobe State in the final of the -54kg event on Thursday inside the Indoor Sports Hall of University of Benin (UNIBEN) and got the sum of N25,000 courtesy of an instant reward package from the Director, Sports Development of the Sports Commission, Mr. Moses Kolawole. “The cash reward is very motivating to me because it came at the right time. This shows that my sweat and determination to fight for gold were not in futility. I thank the Lagos State Sports Commission for this gesture. I am so happy winning a gold medal for Lagos State.” “I want to advise the other athletes, who are still competing for medals to work very hard and enjoy the games.” I am happy we have people at the helms of affairs in the state sports commission, who always notice what we are doing and are ready to reward our efforts,” he stated.
