Troops of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), yesterday, went after bandits that attacked and killed some residents of Anune community, Makurdi Local Council of Benue State. The troop, after its air raid of the criminals’ hideouts on the border between Benue and Nasarawa states, left some of the bandits’ dead, while others were injured. The Guardian learnt that the armed bandits had, in the early hours of yesterday, attacked residents of Anune community, leaving undisclosed number of residents dead with many others injured. It was gathered that the swift response of the OPWS troops, who went after the attackers who were already retreating towards Nasarawa State, saved the situation. According to an anonymous informant in the area who spoke on phone, members of the community saw a helicopter at about 10am yesterday, hovering over their community, as well as some land soldiers in trucks moving into the forest where the attackers had earlier retreated. The informant intimated further that at about two hours later, they saw one of the soldiers’ trucks conveying about five corpses of the armed bandits, who had earlier attacked their community in the morning. But, one of the local sources, Atema Ugoh, said he suspected that the attackers might have ambushed their community in the night to carry out the attack in the morning. Ugoh said to the best of his knowledge, his community had no premonition about the attack, but a merely unprovoked action. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Caterine Anene confirmed the attack on the village. She stated: “Today, (17/4/2021) at about 4.30am, information was received that gunmen invaded Anune, Naka road, Makurdi.  A team of police officers was deployed to the area to forestall further breakdown of law and order.  Further information will be communicated to you, please.” However, all efforts by The Guardian to get the Force Commander of OPWS, Maj. Gen. Adeyemi Yekini to comment on the matter failed, as his phone lines were not reachable at the time of filing this report.
