Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), at the weekend, paraded six persons arrested in connection with alleged illegal bunkering and refining of petroleum products in Olokpobiri, Warri South West, Delta State. Parading the suspects in Asaba, the state commandant of NSCDC, Chike Ikpeamonwu, said the suspects were between the ages of 18 and 30. He alleged that the suspects were working for ‘big men’ behind the scenes. Ikpeamonwu explained that the activities of the vandals had negative economic, pledging his command’s readiness to make it a thing of the past. He said: “It cannot be these suspects we arrested. They are field men. The big man is somewhere, and we will get him.” Some of the suspects explained their involvement in the crime. A suspect, Godstime Aremu, while explaining the processes of refining the illegally bunkered crude in their camps, said: “We take it from the well, then to the oven for cooking until it produces kerosene, diesel.” Other suspects, Samuel Kingsley and Friday Akokoma, said the business is a thriving means of livelihood for them.
