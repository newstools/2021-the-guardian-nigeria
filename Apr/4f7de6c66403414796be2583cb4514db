Former presidential aspirant on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform in 2019, Chief Charles Udeogaranya, has called on President Buhari to make a public statement supporting the quest by the Southeast geo-political zone to produce the president of the country in 2023. In a statement yesterday, Udeogaranya noted that declaring support for the Igbo presidency in 2023 would end all manner of secession and disintegration agenda in the zone. He insisted that a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction is long overdue, recalling that in 2015, President Buhari’s campaign team wooed the Southeast with the promise that he (Buhari) would hand over to someone from the zone. He noted that since the president did not distance himself from the promise at the time, he should make a public pronouncement that his successor would come from the zone. He stressed further that if not for the relentless efforts of the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the North would have seceded from Nigeria. “It’s then very surprising that those leaders of the Southeast laboured for them to still be part of Nigeria are gravely showing signs of ingratitude to Ndigbo to an extent of marginalising Ndigbo into oblivion,” he added.
