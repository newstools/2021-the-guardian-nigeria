Team Edo’s Adegoke Enoch and Team Delta’s Grace Nzubechi, yesterday night, emerged the fastest man and woman respectively, decided at the Samuel Ogbemidia Stadium at the ongoing National Sports Festival holding in Benin City, Edo State. Enoch, who finished in a time of 9.7, won the gold medal in the male category of the 100 metres race, while Nzubechi in a time of 10:8 beat all her opponents in keenly contested final to win gold medal for her state. Alaba Olukunle, also of Edo State, came second in a time of 9.9 to silver, while Team Lagos represented by Jerry Jakpa settled for the bronze medal in a time of 10.00 in the male category. In the other result, Joy Gabriel, also of Team Lagos, clinched the silver medal in a time of 10.9, as Bayelsa State’s Timas Godbless finished third in a time of 11.00 to claim the bronze medal. Other finals in the athletics events continued later at the same venue.
Similarly, Team Lagos will see its boxers compete for gold medals in four finals of the weight categories scheduled for tomorrow at the Oba Akenzua Cultural Centre in Edo State. In one of the semi finals decided yesterday, Shittu Afolabi of Lagos State beat Chinasa Okonrokwo of Team Abia by a split decision of three – two point in the 52-weight class. In another bout, Omole Dolapo beat Ekiti State’s Samuel Tosin via a knock out in the second round to book a ticket into the final, while Adesodun Michael also defeated Team Kebbi’s Oyerinde Kamal by a split-decision of four-one to qualify for the final. In the last fight of the evening, Abdulazeez Osoba, also of Team Lagos, recorded a victory against Osita Umeh of Kogi State. Speaking on the victories of his boys, the Chief coach of Lagos State Amateur Boxing Association, Waheed Shobaloju, said the feats came through strict training the boxers went through prior the festival. Shobolaju, who expressed optimism that at least eight out of the 11 boxers registered would win gold medals at the festival, said, “The reward system being instituted by the management of Lagos State Sports Commission had motivated the pugilists to redouble their efforts,” he said. Meanwhile, the second phase of semi-final bouts would be concluded today at the same venue. The finals of all the bouts are slated for tomorrow at the same venue.
