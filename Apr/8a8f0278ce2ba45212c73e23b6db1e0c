Financial experts have urged the Federal Government to leverage opportunities in exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) to eliminate the risk associated with oil prices.
  
At an Academy Derivatives Market Webinar series themed, ‘Understanding ETD Market’ held in Lagos, on Tuesday, the Vice President, Market Architecture at the FMDQ, Jumoke Olaniyan, said government could leverage derivatives to hedge against crude oil prices.
  
According to her, hedging oil price would enable government to make payment at the initial price the product was locked in case of future volatility.
  
An ETD is a financial contract that is listed and traded on a regulated exchange and has become increasingly popular because of the advantages they have ahead of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as standardisation, liquidity and elimination of default risks.
