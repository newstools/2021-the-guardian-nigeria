Abubakar Malami, AGF Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has denied filing any legal action over the citizenship of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. A section of the media reported yesterday that the AGF filed a suit challenging the citizenship of the former vice president. But Malami, in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Gwandu, yesterday denied the report. He said: “The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has never filed any case before any court in the country challenging the citizenship of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.” According to the statement, the matter in contention was part of the 2019 pre-election matters filed by a civil society organisation, the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa, in suit no: FHC/ABJ/CS/177/2019 in respect of which Abubakar, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Office of the Attorney-General were made co-defendants. “The issue had already been widely reported by the media since April, 2019. It is unfortunate that stale news capable of causing confusion are repackaged and presented to the general public as current news,” he lamented.
