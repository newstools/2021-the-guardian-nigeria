Acclaimed poet, journalist and writer, Uzo Maxim Uzoatu, kickstarted the poetry readings.

The event was both commemorative and celebratory of Pius Adesanmi to whom the anthology is dedicated. Participants highlighted his accomplishments as a writer, scholar and public intellectual. Before his untimely death on March 10, 2019 aboard the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Adesanmi was a professor of English and Director of the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University. Described as “Richly evocative and engaging”, Professor Obioma Nnaemeka, Chancellor’s Professor, Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA, and President, Association of African Women Scholars), said it is a “powerful collection of poems from the heart.” For Professor Olu Obafemi, Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters and recipient of the Nigeria National Order of Merit, the collection is “an assemblage of kindred tongues creating and recreating a new future from an unrelieved past and a censured present… a rare accomplishment.” Professor Toyin Falola noted that the collection is a “magisterial anthology…Verses speak to our expectations—the daydreaming, the anticipations, even the blessings of a temporary moment.” The World Poetry Day virtual launch of Wreaths for a Wayfarer event was sponsored by Carleton University’s Institute of African Studies, Chrisland University, Lunaris, Digirature, and Ngiga Books and Club. Both the Nigerian edition and Canadian edition (published by Daraja Press) of Wreaths for a Wayfarer are internationally available in-store and online for purchase.
