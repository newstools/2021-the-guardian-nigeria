The court of appeal, Gombe division has upturned the conviction and death sentence slammed on one Aminu Abdullahi for armed robbery by the state high court.
  
The panel of three justices comprising Ebiowei Tobi, Hannatu Sankey and Tunde Awotoye unanimously agreed with the appellant that the prosecution could not discharge the burden of proof of the offence against him.
  
Delivering the lead judgment, Justice Tobi held that the prosecution did not prove the ingredients of the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery beyond reasonable doubt, particularly with respect to the fact that the appellant was the one who committed the offences.  Holding further, Justice Tobi said: “The appropriate order to make therefore is to quash the conviction of the appellant and consequently discharge and acquit him for the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery for which he was charged, convicted and sentenced. 
  
“I hereby set aside the conviction of the appellant by the lower court. The appellant is discharged and acquitted for the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery.”
  
The court held that looking at the evidence before the lower court, it was difficult to find any evidence outside the confessional statement of the appellant to corroborate the confession.
  
The victims of the robbery, in their statement and evidence, he held, clearly showed that they could not recognize or identify the appellant as one of those who robbed them.
  
“The only person they could identify and recognize in court was the 1st accused because he was not wearing a mask. All others were wearing mask. From the evidence of PW1 & PW2 found on pages 223-231 of the record, there is nothing to corroborate the confession of the appellant,” the court declared, adding that there was nothing connecting the appellant to the robbery.
