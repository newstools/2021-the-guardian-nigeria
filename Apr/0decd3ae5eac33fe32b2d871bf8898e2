The Rivers State Police Command has confirmed the kidnap of the Chairman of Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State, Philemon Kingoli. Kingoli was whisked away by unknown gunmen in the early of Wednesday along the Peter Odili Road in Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of the State. The incident happened few weeks after gunmen abducted the Traditional Ruler of  Ikuru town, HRM, King Aaron Miller, in Andoni Local Government Area of the State as well as, a senior lecturer at the Department of Linguistics and Communications  Studies, Dr. Jones Ayouwo, who is also king Ikuru’s kinsman. The duo has, however, regained freedom with a trending video from the Monarch’s kidnappers calling on politicians and Royal fathers to enthrone peace in Andoni, saying the inability of the elders to ensure peace and pave way for employments of the teeming youths necessitated their action. Meanwhile, the motive for the latest kidnap of the council chairman is yet unknown as the gunmen are yet to establish contact with his family or anyone. Rivers State police spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, while confirming Kingoli’s kidnap on Thursday, said, efforts are ongoing to rescue the chairman out from his abductors. “There is no contact yet from the kidnappers but we are out to ensure that the man is released timely and unhurt,” Omoni said. “The Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, has directed all the tactical commanders to move in immediately to ensure his release.” In another development, two persons were shot dead on Wednesday night around Victoria and Bende street in the old Port Harcourt township. Eyewitnesses said the killings might be a gang attack in the area. An eyewitness said, “We heard heavy shootings and later found the lifeless body of a young man in the streets” as residents fled for their lives.
