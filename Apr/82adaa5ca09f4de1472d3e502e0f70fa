The revenue generated within the period under review as against the N3.8 billion, a hundred percent increase recorded within the same period in 2020.

The Customs boss regretted that despite the existing laws against the illicit import of items, the men are still battling to curtail the excesses of smugglers trying to smuggle contrabands on daily basis. Suleiman, who declared zero tolerance to any act of illegal importation, revealed that two smugglers were recently intercepted with contraband items worth millions of naira. “It is very unfortunate and disturbing that despite the wide awareness on the dire consequences of smuggling activities on economic growth and development, some citizens still perpetuate this criminal act their selfish interest,” Umar said. “Overtime, the Kano/Jigawa Area Command has been tackling the incessant activities of smugglers within our territories/borders, an activity which has been affecting the nation’s economy and a major contributor to our current Insecurity. We will not relent in intensifying our efforts to curb this menace. “The Nigeria Customs Service’s zero-tolerance for smuggling is non-negotiable and the service will do everything in its capacity to fight to smuggling. “The eagle-eyed operatives of the command succeeded within the period under review (first quarter – January to March) in botching the illicit attempts of smugglers to ferry into the country various contraband goods such as foreign rice, spaghetti, macaroni, bales of second-hand clothes, milk, soap and used tyres worth Duty Paid Value, DPV of N38.5 million,” Umar however stated. This was also as Umar said zero tolerance for smuggling is non-negotiable noting that it would not relent in the arrest and seizure of the smuggled goods.
