 [FILES] Goodluck Jonathan. Photo: TWITTER/GEJONATHAN  Former President Goodluck Jonathan has said he resisted ‘politics of whom you know’ when allocating positions during his reign. He made the submission yesterday while commissioning the N2.2 billion 6.2-kilometre Sabon Kaura-Miri highway in Bauchi State. His words: “I didn’t know Bala Mohammed when I made him Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). In Nigeria, we have this thinking that you must know somebody before securing ‘juicy’ ministries. “But that was not my own way of doing things. Bala Mohammed is a good brother and son. Even when he was the minister, he worked with commitment and I gave him free hand to operate.” The ex-leader stated that it was hard to find true loyalists after office. He added: “It’s a great day for me. And you know why? It’s not always easy for somebody to work with you in Nigeria and still keep identify with after leaving power. “At least I’ve been in government for a reasonable time and I’ve served at quite a number of levels, starting from deputy governor. “Most of my experiences is that after leaving office, some of the people you think that wouldn’t eat if they don’t see you would just forget that you even exist.” He commended the host Governor Mohammed for counting him worthy to inaugurate his first completed major project, describing the gesture as a “big honour.” Jonathan was, in addition, conferred with a traditional title by the Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Adamu. Responding, Mohammed described his visitor as a “champion of democracy who has shown to the world that he is a good Democrat.” The governor recalled that Jonathan appointed him a minister from an opposition political party.
