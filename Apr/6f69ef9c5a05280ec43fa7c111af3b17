Laycon With his debut album scheduled to drop on April 30, BBNaija Season 5 winner Laycon released a new song on Thursday night, which serves as a prologue to the Shall We Begin album. Two singles – ‘Wagwan’ and ‘Fall for Me’ featuring his regular collaborator Yusuf Kanbai – have been released from the album expected to cement Laycon’s status as a rapper/singer, and not just a reality TV show winner. In the latest song titled ‘Before She Spoke (The Presidential Address),’ Laycon gives those who still doubt his talent reasons to look past his BBNaija days. It sees him coming to terms with fame and owning his space as a rapper. “The haters waiting to say, ‘I told you so’/ They couldn’t make past the show/ They watch us grow,” Laycon raps over a minimalist beat that helps emphasise the lyrics. Well, it is called a presidential address for a reason. The 1 minute, 59 second-song released on Facebook also sees the president of icons, as his fans are known, pile on the bragging rights. “Shall we begin to brag please/ They kinda have no f#$king clue/comparing me to people when I’m making music with those people.” Do you remember he wrote for the Time Magazine about Davido for the TIME100 Next 2021 List back in February? That’s one thing he also brags about in the song. Not just that. Laycon says on the song that he has “quadrupled” the N30 million prize money he won on BBNaija less than a year ago. “F*&^ setting trends, I set up my life forever/ Shall we begin to talk money/ I will only say it is not mouth/I’m laying foundation for music/Laying foundation for the fourth house…/ As a presidential address goes, this one will give Laycon’s fans about 22 days of bragging rights on social media before the album is released.
