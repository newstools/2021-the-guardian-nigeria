You’ll recall that many of the states have some of the insecurities that are very similar. So we put them together and see how to address some of those issues. And we felt that we must also meet Mr. President about it since it’s about the insecurity.” The Governor declined to disclose the takeaway. But said the meeting “was very fruitful and we are also very committed, and we have seen a lot of commitment, so we are waiting for implementation. “The assurance I will give you is that based on this meeting, we will also wait to see the commitment, and Mr. President has given us that assurance.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
