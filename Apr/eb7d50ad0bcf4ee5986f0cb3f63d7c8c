He stated this during his visit to Owerri, Imo State, where he commissioned a road project executed by the state government. The Vice President also visited the state Police Headquarters and the Owerri Correctional Centre, which were attacked by hoodlums. He condemned the attacks as an assault on the people, saying: “Our system is not perfect, but democracy provides channels for seeking redress for injury and peaceful resolution of issues. “There are many working tirelessly to improve our system, to build it up and enhance it. We must, therefore, reject the agents of anarchy seeking to exploit the frustration and discontent of our young people for their own selfish ends. “Violence can only lead to a disaster that could consume everyone and leads to desolation of our communities. It is easy to take peace for granted, but we need not learn the value of peace through the horrible crucible of war.” Osinbajo, who further charged Nigerians to reject groups that want to sow violence and destruction, stressed that Nigerians must reject any attempt to portray the criminal elements as anything other than representatives of their own malice and hatred. “They do not represent the good people of Imo State and the South East geopolitical zone. Perpetrators of violence do not represent the good people of this state and this zone. “I, therefore, charged all of us to come together to resist any attempt to turn the progress and peace that the South East zone is set to experience to conflict and disruption,” he said. He maintained that an attack on critical institutions of law enforcement, police stations and prisons was an attack on the safety, security and wellbeing of Nigerians, insisting that it was not merely an assault on law and order, but an attack on the people. “When you attack police stations and free criminals, you put men, women, children, their possessions and livelihoods at risk. Whatever the motives of the perpetrators, their action is egregious and atrocious in the extreme, and all men and women of goodwill must condemn the assault on Imo people,” he stressed. Osinbajo, however, assured the people that government had beefed up the security in Owerri and the entire state and that government would further strengthen the security capacity in the state. Speaking, Governor Hope Uzodinma commended the Vice President for visiting the state to commission the road project and see the destruction of the State Police Command Headquarters and the Correctional Centre for himself. He added that the people remain confident of Federal Government ability and support to address the security challenges confronting the state. On Osinbajo’s entourage to the state were Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba and Special Adviser to the President on Political Affairs, Babafemi Ojudu, among others.
