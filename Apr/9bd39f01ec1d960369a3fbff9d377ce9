 Kumuyi  Like Christ, Christians must keep the purpose of the ministry and the mission in mind. If we lose the purpose of the mission, then our evangelism becomes meaningless. If we miss or misunderstand His purpose, goal and mission, following His method without upholding His message will mean nothing; practising His pattern without pursuing His purpose will not achieve anything. Walking in the footsteps of Christ without following the commandments and the will of God will not make us achieve heaven’s goal. The builders of Babel, Ahab and Jehoshaphat, and the Pharisees and Sadducees all had goals, which were not heaven’s goal. As we pursue, commit and consecrate ourselves to spreading the good news of Christ’s sacrifice for the salvation of mankind, it must be Christ-like and purposeful evangelism. Christian leaders and churches must have Christ’s mind, not just His method. The foundation of the work of God is Christ’s mind, nature, purpose, thought, concern, self-sacrifice, willingness and pursuit to fulfil and achieve heaven’s goal. When we go out to preach, we should tell sinners about Christ and let them see the danger of sin, the doom in sinning, why they should make haste to come out of their sin and have the Kingdom of God established in their hearts. Ultimately, Christ wants to get us out of sin, shame, disgrace, degradation and defilement; He wants to cleanse, forgive, set us free and bring us to glory. Christ was truthful and faithful. He emphasised and demanded repentance in His message. There is no real evangelism, if we are not faithful to the Scriptures or truthful to sinners. No one can gate-crash into heaven. Being a member of a particular denomination is not repentance and without repentance, there is no salvation. We must make the people we share the word of God with, to understand that going to church or merely being religious does not save from sin. One can only be saved, if he “repent… and believe the gospel.” As believers, we must be faithful like Christ. Many Christians identify with His name as well as with various denominations, yet the corruption in the society is on the increase. This is because they are not faithfully preaching repentance to people. We must ensure that “repentance and remission of sins [is] preached in his name among all nations…” Without repentance, there is no heaven for a sinning churchgoer. Those who are still in the darkness of occultism and secret sin must repent and after that transformation, “go, and sin no more”. However, forgiveness is not a licence to keep on sinning. Only those who “continue” in His ways, Christ says, “are… my disciples indeed.” One who has not repented of his sins, does not know the truth. He may know the doctrines of the Bible and yet not be free from sin. But if the truth gets to the heart, soul and spirit, it shall “make you free.” Further Reading (King James Version): Matthew 4:17; 9:13; 1:21; Luke 19:10; 1 Timothy 1:15; 1 Peter 3:18; Hebrews 2:10; Acts 15:14,28,29.
