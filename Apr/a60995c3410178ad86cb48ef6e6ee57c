The COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) has reviewed reports of rare cases of blood clots with low platelets following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (including Covishield) since their onset a few weeks ago.  At its most recent meeting on 7 April, 2021, the subcommittee reviewed latest information from the European Medicines Agency (https://bit.ly/3mDu1Wx) along with information from the United Kingdom’s Medicines and other Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (https://bit.ly/2OxQ8ku), and other Member States and noted the following: WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations. In extensive vaccination campaigns, it is normal for countries to identify potential adverse events following immunization. This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but they must be investigated to ensure that any safety concerns are addressed quickly. Vaccines, like all medicines, can have side effects. The administration of vaccines is based on a risk versus benefit analysis. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of World Health Organization (WHO).
