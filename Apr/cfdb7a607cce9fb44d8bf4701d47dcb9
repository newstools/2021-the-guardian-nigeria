The South-West Zonal Congress of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which will hold on Monday, April 12, has been shifted from Ibadan to Osogbo, Osun State capital. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this via a post on his twitter handle. He said the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party had moved the venue to Osogbo, the Osun State capital. He said: “The South-West congress is scheduled for Monday, April 12, 2021. “Party assures of working with all stakeholders to achieve a seamless and unifying congress,” he tweeted. Meanwhile, some PDP leaders in the South-West have dispelled the rumours making the rounds that the NWC of the party shifted the zonal congress of the party to Osogbo, Osun State capital, to checkmate excesses of a faction in the zone. Some of the party leaders, who spoke with The Guardian, said there was nothing in the constitution of the party suggesting that the zonal congress of the party must be held in Ibadan. The leaders said this was not the first time the party would hold the zonal congress outside Ibadan, saying that in 2012, the party held the South-West zonal congress in Osogbo and also in 2016, it was held in Akure, the Ondo State Capital. Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde had canvassed that the congress should be held in Ibadan. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
