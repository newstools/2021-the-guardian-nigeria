Seek redrafting of community trust fund section Nigerians in diaspora, under the aegis of Isoko Association of North America, have petitioned the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, over the Petroleum Industry Bill, alleging that the document would worsen the already-cold relationship between oil companies and their host communities.  The bill says that “wherein any year, an act of vandalism, sabotage or other civil unrest occurs that causes damage to petroleum and designated facilities or disrupts production activities within the host community, the community shall forfeit its entitlement to the extent of the cost of repairs of the damage that resulted from the activity with respect to the provision of this Act within the financial year”.
