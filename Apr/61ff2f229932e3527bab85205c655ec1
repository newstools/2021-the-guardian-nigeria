Comedienne Ada Jesus Dead After Battle With Kidney Disease Comedienne, Ada Jesus, has died. She died in an Abuja hospital today April 21. She suffered a cardiac arrest on Tuesday night, April 20, and was rushed to the ICU where the doctors monitored her. Sadly, she lost the battle to the kidney ailment she had been battling with on Wednesday, April 21. Ada Jesus was admitted to the hospital after she was diagnosed with kidney disease. When her health took a turn for the worse, she went to ask for forgiveness from those she had spoken against in the past, including the popular Pastor, Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanemere Odumejeje, and actress Rita Edochie. She also visited some traditional worshipers. Odumejeje’s and Rita Edochie’s initial refusal to forgive her got the attention of well-meaning Nigerians who decided to take care of her medical bills so that she can get dialysis. Her health which was said to have improved, took a different turn last night until she breathed her last. Two days ago, she celebrated her birthday on her hospital bed with so many Nigerians sending in their congratulatory messages. Human rights activist, Gwamnishu, who offered to help her get proper medical care celebrated the day for her on her hospital bed. There were other people in the room as well and they ensured to make the day memorable for Ada Jesus. Ada Jesus seemed to look quite better from previous photos on the internet. Unknown to her, that would be the last birthday celebration she would have before taking her last breathe earlier today. A while back, Ada Jesus came out to accuse Edochie and Prophet Odumeje of performing fake miracles. It has been said that the ailment was a result of her accusation against the prophet. After some back and forth, Odumeje and Edochie came forward to say they have forgiven her. Pastor Odumeje further offered her some money for her treatment. May her soul Rest in Peace.
