IPOB stressed that it could not partner with the new outfit despite several calls from notable Igbo people for their collaboration, insisting that the circumstances behind its formation were suspicious. In a statement issued in Enugu by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, it described Ebube Agu as an ‘imaginary security outfit’, alleging that the motive of those behind the Ebube Agu was to scuttle the bond among Ndigbo and set the youths against themselves. IPOB wondered how the governors could wake up one morning and announce an unprepared regional security outfit, adding: “We all knew the circumstances that gave birth to ESN. It was when the governors failed to stand with the people who were being raped and slaughtered daily by Fulani herdsmen and jihadists that our leader, based on the yearnings of the people had to establish ESN to save the situation. And ever since then, the narrative has changed. “Out of envy and jealousy as those being remote-controlled by the Caliphate, the South East governors belatedly, and without coordination announced a ghost security outfit. “For the discerning minds, the action of the governors and their slave masters is suspicious. They are out for something sinister, but we are too smart to fall for it.” He argued that when the South West governors formed Amotekun, they were prepared with their personnel and equipment and that when IPOB leader established ESN, he trained men for the mission. How then are you asking ESN to collaborate with ghost Ebube Agu that has no identifiable personnel? How can ESN collaborate with Ebubeagu that is being supervised by the compromised Fulani-controlled Nigeria security agencies?, he asked. “Asking ESN to collaborate with Ebube Agu is like asking Lucifer to midwife the birth of Jesus Christ. But for the gullible, it was simply floated to spy on ESN and IPOB. The aim of the Caliphate in forcing their puppets called South East governors to float the imaginary outfit is to scuttle the bond among Ndigbo and set our youths against themselves, but we are ahead of them in this game,” he added. IPOB further stated that if the South East governors were sincere, they would have supported ESN, which had been doing a good job since inception rather than floating Ebube Agu, which it described as a “joke and mockery.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
