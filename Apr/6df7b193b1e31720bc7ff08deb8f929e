The 74-year-old was the only name in the running since the window for potential candidates to apply opened at the start of the month. A club statement said: “A single candidate was validated by the electoral committee….and D. Florentino Perez Rodriguez is proclaimed president”. Perez, the head of major construction group ACS, has already twice been re-elected unopposed, in 2013 and 2017. He was the man behind Madrid’s star-studded ‘Galacticos’ era in his first spell in charge of the club between 2000-2006. His latest mandate will see him at the helm until 2025.
