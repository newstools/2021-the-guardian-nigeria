Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection that affects both men and women. It is caused by the Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and, if left untreated, could cause serious complications later. But a message posted on a Nigeria-based Facebook page that promotes herbal cures claims that eating garlic on an empty stomach will cure chlamydia. It reads: “Eat 2 to 4 cloves of garlic in the morning on an empty stomach for 1 month and go for tests to confirm that your chlamydia is finished. This treatment is too effective.” Will this regimen cure chlamydia? We checked.  According to the US-based Mayo Clinic, signs and symptoms of infection by the Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria may include: And over the long term, the infection could cause permanent damage. “Chlamydia infection can affect the eyes and cause blindness and damage the urinary tract if not managed well and treated over time,” Ademola Popoola, a senior lecturer and consultant urologist, told Africa Check. “The basic treatment is antibiotics,” Popoola added. The UK’s National Health Service gives similar advice. “Chlamydia can be easily cured with antibiotics,” its advisory on the infection reads. “Persons with chlamydia should abstain from sexual activity for seven days after single dose antibiotics or until completion of a seven-day course of antibiotics, to prevent spreading the infection to partners. It is important to take all of the medication prescribed to cure chlamydia.” Eating garlic on an empty stomach won’t cure chlamydia. Consult your doctor instead.
