Suspected car thief Operatives of Ogun State Police Command have arrested a car wash operator, Kazeem Olanrewaju, who stole a Toyota Venza car with registration number APP 775 GB, in FESTAC area of Lagos State. The suspect was arrested when the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Idiroko Division, CSP Shadrach Oriloye, was on routine patrol with his men, and sighted the car without a number plate, driven in a suspicious manner. He was reportedly flagged down, but instead of stopping, he sped off. He was subsequently chased and apprehended. On searching the vehicle, it was discovered that the number plate was removed and kept in the car. On interrogation, he confessed that he was working with a car wash station in FESTAC town, Lagos State, and he was given the car by a customer to wash while the owner went to a nearby barbing saloon to have his hair cut. He added that he ran away with the vehicle before the arrival of its owner because he had the car key. In a statement by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), the suspect was on his way to the neighbouring Benin Republic with the car when he was caught by the DPO and his men. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the case was reported at FESTAC town police station by the owner of the car and the station had been on lookout for possible recovery of the car. The station has since been informed of the recovery,” he said. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Awolowo Ajogun, has ordered a thorough investigation into the past activities of the suspect before handing him over to Lagos State Police Command for prosecution.
