A foreign firm, Eutawa Construction Company Incorporated, United States of America, and its Nigeria partner, Eutawa Construction & Development Nigeria Limited have jointly filed a Notice of Appeal challenging the decision of the FCT High Court, which barred them from executing the over N4 billion contract of refurbishing the Akure branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
   
The appellants are asking the court to enter judgment against the respondent to cause it to pay them the sum of N12,945,320,000 as compensation and damages for flagrant breach of the contract.  Shishi, therefore, said that the court abdicated on its responsibilities to meticulously attend to the contested issues, adding that it was this failure that led the judge to decide against the suit.
   
The Guardian recalls that the claimants, Eutawa had in suit CV/1147/14 approached the lower court for a redress against CBN’s clear breach of contract by denying the claimants right to execute the contract after due agreement was entered by the parties.  They also asked for an order for general damages in the sum of Five Billion Naira (N5,000,000,000) and an order for compensation for loss of anticipated profits in the sum of N1,200,000,000 respectively.
   
The companies further prayed for an order for N5,000,000,000 and order for interest pursuant to the Central Bank of Nigeria maximum commercial interest rate and 30 per cent interest on judgement sum from the date of judgement to the date of a final liquidation.
