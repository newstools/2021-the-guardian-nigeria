Founder, Academy for Entrepreneurial Studies (AES) Nigeria, Ausbeth Ajagu, has called for good leaders who would move the country forward. Noting that Nigeria was blessed with an abundance of resources, he stressed that the problem with Nigeria was because it has not got the right crop of leaders, who would lead the country aright. Ajagu, who is also a clergyman, said God, who has the power to change everything, is not yet through with Nigeria as the best was yet to come. “But we must have the right mindset and never allow men and women who do not qualify to be in leadership positions, grab the reins of power, but we must work and pray for the right leaders,” he said. Giving insights into a leadership and entrepreneurship training programme organised by The Pentium Ministries, with the theme, ‘Dinner with the King’, he said youths, who would attend would be given a 50 per cent discount on its product offerings on leadership, mentorship, and entrepreneurship among other training offers. The opportunity, he said, would expose such youths to knowledge on networking; job opportunities, references, and recommendations even to travel overseas. According to him: “We want to give the youths reasons to live and lead a Godly life rather than indulging in all manners of an evil act. Our academy is poised to give hope to young people by offering several correctional incentives to help ameliorate youths’ plights. But the youths must have the right mindsets of divinity, humanity, and life at large. “As elections draw nigh, I desire that the youths would conscientiously forgo immediate fantasies and go for the ultimate. The ultimate is the result, which is the democracy dividends. If you go for the immediate fantasies and ecstasies, your future is doomed.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
