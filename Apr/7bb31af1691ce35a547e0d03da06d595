6 Tips On How To Avoid Wearing A Strapless Bra You probably have that fire dress hanging at the back of your closet because you didn’t want to wear a strapless bra. Understandably, strapless bras can be a buzz kill, you either have to hoist it up every few seconds or worry about the accidental wardrobe malfunction. Let us not forget the weird shape your breasts can have or the curing of your circulation. If you are looking at skipping this piece of lingerie, there are ways to make that braless look work without drawing attention. From DIYing a built-in bra to getting a little high-fashion with your bra selection to straight-up pasties, here are a few helpful hacks for avoiding strapless bras. Go Braless
This is not advice for everyone as not all ladies are comfortable with the idea but if you are, it might save you some serious hassle and discomfort. Sew Bra Cups Into Your Dress
Yes, this requires more effort but it saves you a lot of headache in the long run. You can buy a budget bra in your size and have it sewn into your strapless dress. Go For Pasties
Pasties come in handy for the women who don’t mind less support when rocking strapless dresses. Go For Styles With More Support
If you can find a corset-style strapless dress, chances are you’ll be able to get away without wearing a bra, even if you generally like more support. Wear A Delicate Bralette
It is a little less in your face but remains pretty. Wear A Shirt Under The Dress
Wearing something like a T-shirt or a button-down underneath your strapless dress makes it unnecessary to wear a bra.
