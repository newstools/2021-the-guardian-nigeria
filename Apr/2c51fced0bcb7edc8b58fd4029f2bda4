Concerned about constant abuse of children and women, a legal practitioner and marriage counsellor, Olumide Omosebi, has urged stakeholders to defend the vulnerable in society against all forms of domestic violence. Omosebi charged youths on exhibiting good character traits and ensuring compatibility in their partners to enable them enjoy healthy relationships and their unions. Omosebi, who is also the founder of Gnosis Help Initiative (GHI), said this at a one-day training organised for youths in Lagos, stressing that the training was part of efforts to build happy and healthy relationships devoid of abuse and domestic violence	. He urged girls and women to be strong to enable them  break barriers and refuse to keep silent when violated, opposed and intimidated, adding: “You can only get help when you call for it. Don’t be silent when being abused or violated against your will.” He recounted different cases and reports of domestic violence, emotional and physical abuse of girls, women and even men, who had met their untimely deaths in abusive relationships and marriages. Omosebi noted that most people go into relationships with the aim of changing the character and lifestyles of their partners, saying that it was strictly God’s duty to change people. He said most couples still practice outdated and harmful customs and traditions that are detrimental to marriage oaths. “They increase the pains, abuse, loss of memory, depression or sudden death of their spouses,” he said. He encouraged the participants to know themselves through self-discovery, boundaries, strengths and weaknesses, read books, listen to enlightening programmes and attend training programmes.
