Over 4.5 million fraudulent print products, parts and components, including large numbers of ink and toner cartridges have been seized in raids across Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and the Americas.
    
HP Anti-Counterfeiting and Fraud (ACF) team, which led the raid and confiscation, said the seizures took place between November 2019 and October 2020, during a year where COVID-19 created extraordinary challenges in the battle against fake print supplies around the world.
   
HP explained that between government shutdowns, labour shortages, and changes in custom control priorities, criminal networks have adjusted their strategies to take advantage of the evolving landscape.
   
The firm said eCommerce has become intensely exploited as consumers and businesses turn to online shopping. HP’s ACF team had to quickly adapt to find new ways to protect its customers from these illicit e-traders – leading to 224,000 de-listings of counterfeit cartridges from online marketplaces.  In contrast, original HP products are designed to meet HP’s strict quality and reliability standards, based on a long history of innovation, research and testing. Original HP LaserJet and HP inkjet cartridges, unlike counterfeits, benefit from outstanding performance and consistent results.
