 Ekiti state  The kidnap of Itakorode, General Manager of Prosperous Filling Station, happened a few months after a chieftain of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Alhaji Suleiman Akinbami, was abducted by unknown gunmen at his filling station along Ado-Ijan road. It was gathered that about eight gunmen invaded the petrol station around 7 pm on Thursday and abducted the victim. Spokesman of the state Police Command, Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the incident, said a team of Police operatives and detectives, including the Amotekun Corps and local hunters, have been deployed and mandated to comb the bushes and forests across the state to rescue the victim. Abutu explained that the gunmen stormed the filling station through the bush in about six motorcycles and started shooting sporadically before whisking the victim away, adding: “The Command, in addition to the rescue teams deployed, has contacted all the states bordering Ekiti State for possible assistance towards the rescue of the victim and the arrest of the perpetrators.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
