Speaking in Port Harcourt when briefing sports journalists on Team Rivers preparation for the forthcoming National Sports Festival in Benin, Edo State, Iyaye noted that with the plethora of solid road networks within the state capital and beyond, Rivers State was in a position to host local and international marathon races and cycling competitions, in addition to beach soccer and volleyball at reclaimed lands. The commissioner emphasised that one of the parameters of awarding hosting rights to cities is good road networks, which ease the movement of officials and participating sportsmen and women. He added that to further deepen his love for sports development and economic growth, the governor built a world-class football academy; the Real Madrid Football Academy. “We must commend Governor Nyesom Wike for his vision and sense of responsibility. His broad approach to developmental issues has also triggered opportunities in the sports sector. “We can now host national and international marathons because we have solid road networks that include no fewer than eight flyovers, just as cycling can also take place in our state. “On our part as a ministry, we are ready to collaborate with local and foreign sponsors who want to organise sporting activities in the state in line with the new vision. Our doors are open for partnerships and collaborations in developing sports in the state,” he said.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
