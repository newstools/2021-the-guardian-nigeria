The Anambra State Commissioner for Public Utilities, Emeka Ezenwanne, abducted during the attack on former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Chief Chukwuma Soludo, last week, at Isuofia Civic Centre in Aguata Local Council of the state, has been released. A source close to the commissioner said the commissioner was released unhurt by 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning but did not give details on the location of his release. He also said that no ransom was paid to the abductors before Ezenwanne regained his freedom.
