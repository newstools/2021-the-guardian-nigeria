Barely two years to the 2023 Presidential election, campaign posters announcing a supposed relaunch of the presidential aspiration of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, flooded some streets of Abuja on Tuesday. Saraki came third behind Sokoto state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar (the eventual winner) in the 2018 presidential primary election of the PDP in Port Harcourt. That election featured heavyweight politicians including former Kano state governor, Rabiu Kwakwanso, ex-President of the Senate, David Mark, former Sokoto state governor, Atthiru Bafarawa amongst others. At the federal secretariat and Wadata Plaza, headquarters of PDP, Saraki is seen smiling in a picture from campaign posters with the inscription, “Reset Nigeria 2023: Vote Abubakar Bukola Saraki as President.” A media aide to Saraki, Yusuph Olaniyonu, to The Guardian that knows nothing about the posters. “We do not know anything about the posters,” Olaniyonu said. “We are ignoring it.” At the moment, Saraki is the chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party to reconcile aggrieved members and woo new members into its fold ahead of the 2023 general elections.
