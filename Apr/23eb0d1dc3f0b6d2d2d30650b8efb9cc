As commercial bank loan portfolio exceeds 20tr The total commercial loans to the government, at all levels, rose to N1.77 trillion at the close of last year, about 18 per cent increase from the N1.5 trillion reported in December 2019.
  
This comes as the total outstanding commercial loans written by the banks rose to N20.4 trillion in December, putting the exposure to government alone at 8.7 per cent.
   
The figures are contained in the industry data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) yesterday.  Public sector loans have increased steadily despite caution that the governments’ rising penchant for domestic loans is inadvertently crowding out the private sector. Manufacturers have pointed out access to funding as one of the major challenges limiting their competitiveness and responsible for the high rate of business closure.  According to the report, the total number of banks’ staff reduced by 0.9 per cent, from 95,888 to 95,026, between October and December.
