The operatives of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) yesterday apprehended an unnumbered vehicle used for one-chance robbery. The wine coloured Toyota Camry Sedan vehicle reportedly conveying a victim was intercepted at Ikate, Lekki-Ajah axis of the state. The car, which was being driven suspiciously against traffic, popularly known as one-way driving, was stopped by LASTMA officials. According to spokesman of LASTMA, Filade Olumide, “It was revealed that while the driver was being interviewed by the officers, a lady came raising the alarm that she boarded the vehicle unknowingly that it was a one-chance vehicle, she further narrated that all her valuables were forcefully taken away from her and they include her phone, ATM debit card and some other items. “The two one-chance robbers and the victim were subsequently taken and handed over to the police at Maroko Division by the LASTMA officials for thorough investigation and prosecution by the police.” The General Manager of LASTMA, Olajide Oduyoye, lauded the operatives who achieved the feat saying LASTMA does not only manage traffic on Lagos roads but also renders humanitarian services. He recalled the assistance rendered by some LASTMA officials to a pregnant lady and her child at Fagba area of Iju-Ishaga axis of the state, who had an accident on a commercial motorcycle that plied one-way about a week ago. Oduyoye urged Lagos residents to be vigilant when boarding commercial vehicles. He charged drivers to obey Lagos State traffic laws as promulgated by the State House of Assembly.
