WASHINGTON, DC – APRIL 21: U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks about a jury’s verdict in the case against former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd, at the Department of Justice on April 21, 2021 in Washington, DC. Garland announced a civil investigation into Minneapolis, Minnesota policing practices after Chauvin was found guilty on Tuesday of all three charges against him in the murder of Floyd last May.

He said the civil probe — separate from an ongoing criminal investigation into Floyd’s death — will examine whether the police systematically engaged in the use of excessive force, including during legal protests. It will also examine whether the city force showed a pattern of discrimination and unlawful treatment of people with behavioural health disabilities, Garland said. If evidence is found of a pattern of unlawful practices, the investigation could possibly lead to a civil lawsuit seeking to compel the city to undertake sweeping reforms of its police department. “The Justice Department will be unwavering in its pursuit of equal justice under law,” Garland said.
