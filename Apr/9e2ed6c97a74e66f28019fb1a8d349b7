Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) has empowered a total of 16,000 women in all the 16 local government areas of Kwara State. Each of the 16,000 rural women was given N10, 000 to help boost their trades and also start new businesses. The money was given to the rural women in a funfair event, held in Moro Local Government area of Kwara State. Deputy Governor of the state, who stood in for the Governor, Abdulraham Abdulrasaq, lauded the ADF empowerment programme, describing it as part of the key economic tools needed to boost the socio-economic activities of the rural areas. He said: “This Aliko Dangote Foundation empowerment programme will impact positively on the socio-economic activity of our state. We are so pleased with this and cannot thank Aliko Dangote enough. We don’t want people to come and unnecessarily populate the urban areas, we want to encourage people to stay in the rural areas and add value to the respective lives and also to the state economy. This indeed is a noble gesture.” Dangote’s Group Executive Director, Government and Strategic Relations, Ahmed Mansur, who represented Aliko Dangote said: “This investment in the rural areas will circulate well in these rural areas and also boost the economy of the state eventually. We are going to do this in all the local governments in Nigeria.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
