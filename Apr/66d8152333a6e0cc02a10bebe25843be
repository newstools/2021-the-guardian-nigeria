After much controversy over travel hitches due to poor finances, Enyimba will today embark on trip to Libya, where they will battle Ahli Benghazi in matchday four of the on-going CAF Confederation Cup. The match will hold in the Libyan city tomorrow. Enyimba Head Coach, Fatai Osho, yesterday said the players and officials were primed to leave for the game, which a draw or win would enhance the Peoples Elephant’s quest for a quarterfinals ticket. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Osho said the now resolved travel hitches would not affect his team in the game, adding that the players know the importance of the match. “We have just finished our training and the club management has told the team to prepare for the journey on Tuesday. At this point, I don’t know the particular time the team will move or the airline we are traveling with. “All I can say is that the management of Enyimba has told the team to prepare to depart for Libya on Tuesday. I am not under pressure, but my players are ready to get victory in Libya,” he said. Osho also disclosed that Enyimba has written to PTF to allow the former African champions host Orlando Pirates of South Africa in Aba despite the COVID-19 restrictions on visitors coming from that region of Africa. “I don’t think PTF has communicated to the management. We are still waiting for their response,” he said. The Guardian learnt that Air Peace boss, Allen Onyeama, is helping to airlift Enyimba to Libya due to the financial challenges facing the team, which has made it difficult for them to pay for a chartered flight to Libya.
