Cautions Adeyeye against untoward activity 
The Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has denied supporting presidential bid of any aspirant for the 2023 presidential election. In a statement, yesterday, Afenifere Director of Communication, Mr. Sola Lawal, dismissed the viral statement by the leader of South West Agenda (SWAGA), Dayo Adeyeye, purporting that his group secured support of Afenifere for its candidate during a visit to Pa Reuben Fasoranti, erstwhile Afenifere leader, during the week. Lawal said that the group was still mourning its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, in whose honour the group suspended all engagements. He also pointed out that 96-year-old Fasoranti had taken a “deserved rest when he formally handed over to Chief Ayo Adebanjo three weeks ago after leading the group for 12 years and so the former couldn’t have spoken for Afenifere during the SWAGA visit to his Akure home.” The group further said it had temporarily halted all activities in honour of Odumakin who is still lying in the morgue, cold and lonely. “The Adeyeye foray into Afenifere space at this period of huge loss and intense mourning is disrespectful, insensitive and unwarranted. “Being a former Afenifere top-notch and, in fact, Odumakin’s immediate predecessor in office as spokesperson for Afenifere, Adeyeye should cease all activities and join us in mourning at this trying times,” Lawal said.
