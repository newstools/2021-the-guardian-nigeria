The Federal Government is spending N5.6 billion on women empowerment and fight against Gender-Based-Violence (GBV) this year.
Director General, National Centre for Women Development, Mrs. Mary Ekpere-Eta, who disclosed this yesterday in a chat with journalists to mark her fourth year in office, noted that the vote underscored President Muhammadu Buhari’s zeal for issues concerning women. “Before this administration, the center’s budget hovers between N100 million and N200 million. But as at today, we have a budget that can be used to carry out sizable things for women, though we still need more government’s support financially,” she clarified. According to her, the empowerment is critical to the centre’s quest to improving the lot of women, especially those in the rural areas through sustainable development programmes.
