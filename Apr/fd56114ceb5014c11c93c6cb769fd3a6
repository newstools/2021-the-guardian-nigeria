Wike, who said he was prepared for political travails after leaving office, advised Okorocha to continue to pursue his vision of a new Nigeria, adding that his present challenges were meant to dampen his spirit and force him to abandon his ambition. Okorocha has been having a running battle with Governor Hope Uzodimma, resulting in the seizure of property of his family members and being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft agency had detained him for 48 hours last week before he was granted bail. But speaking in Abuja at the dedication of Okorocha’s grandson, Wike noted that the political battle Okorocha and his wife had been through would cause them to rely on God and not on their own strength. He tasked the former Imo Governor to consider joining other Nigerians who are determined to pull the country from the brink of economic collapse. “Political persecution must come, especially after one leaves office, so what you’re going through is not peculiar to you and your family. I know they will come after me, but I am ready for them,” he said. Wike commended Uche Nwosu and his (Okorocha’s) wife, Uloma, for organising a church service to dedicate their son to God, adding that the reason he (Wike) had survived several fierce political battles was because he had never stopped appreciating God. He, however, explained that his attending the dedication service was devoid of politics or political affiliation, adding that his relationship with Okorocha, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), started in 1999 when he was chairman of Obio-Akpor Council of Rivers State. “I’ve known him since 1999. I don’t abandon people because of politics or whatever. It is my character to always keep my friendship with people, not based on party or politics. Friendship is friendship,” Wike said.
