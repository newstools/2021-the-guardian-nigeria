The Onogie of Okhue Esan Kingdom of Edo State, Zaiki Ehidiamen Ataimen III, and his subjects have praised Africa’s costliest footballer, Victor Osimhen, for his charity works, including the assistance to Lagos amputee hawker, Mary Daniel. Osimhen hails from Okhue-Esan kingdom in Esan South East Council of Edo State. Speaking with journalists during the 2021 yearly Okhue-Esan day celebration at the weekend, the monarch urged youths of his community to emulate the 22-year-old Super Eagles striker’s industry, saying the Napoli of Italy striker has been a source of pride to the kingdom, Edo State and Nigeria in general. Calling for more support for Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, Ataimen III hailed the governor for his respect for the rule of law and traditional institutions in the state. He added: “I commend Victor Osimhen for his uniqueness and football skills, as well as Governor Obaseki for his aggressive efforts at industrialising Edo State culminating in making the state an industrial hub.” “On our part, we will continue to pray, support, Victor Osimen and cooperate and be loyal to this government to attain our lofty idea as a people.” The monarch appealed to indigenes of Okue-Esan Kingdom to strive at all times to give back to the kingdom by coming home regularly, using their experiences, exposure and resources to impact on the people back at home.
