Representative of G74, Mr. Idoreyin Udi (right), Ms Ekong and Mrs. Esther Maurice Obot, during presentation of the wheelchair to her in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. She was a super sprinter in her heyday. Ms Affiong Ekong was an excellent 100-metre runner for Lutheran High School, Obot Idim Ibesikpo, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, as a student in the mid-70s. Affiong was popularly known by her fellow students and friends then as ‘Spring’ because of her dexterity in sports. That was then. Everything has changed, though she is still a very fulfilled and happy person. Those legs she used to make her school, fellow students and family members proud are no more. She is, at present, an amputee as a result of diabetes. Both legs have been amputated. Touched by her story, some of her classmates in Lutheran High School decided to put a smile on her face, as members of G74 of her alma mater, including Maurice Obot, Dr. Peter Raphael and Allan Mark recently donated a new wheelchair to her. They also gave her an undisclosed amount of money out of magnanimity and service to humanity. She was grateful to them for their kind gesture and appealed to kind-hearted Nigerians to always assist those in need.
