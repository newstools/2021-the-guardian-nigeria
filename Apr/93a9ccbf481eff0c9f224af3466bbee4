Speakers at the graduation of Nexford University’s first class of Nigerian MBA students, including Olamidun Majekudunmi, Ituah Ighodalo, and Obiageli Ezekwesili, have called for enhanced access through virtual learning and private partnership education funding model for tertiary institutions in Nigeria. No fewer than 200 Nigerians graduated from the virtual MBA programme of the university. Country Director, Nexford University in Nigeria, Majekodunmi, in her remarks, disclosed that the idea of having the varsity’s online MBA was conceived five years ago. The idea of a next-generation university, where learners’ progress, based on the mastery of competencies, could achieve affordable, high-quality learning and be adequately prepared specifically for today’s world. She, therefore, called for a new way of learning that could forever change the way higher education is delivered, if done right. Senior Pastor of Trinity House Church, Ighodalo, regretted that the COVID-19 pandemic made virtual education part of the new normal. In the last 18 months, young people have not been able to go to any university because of the pandemic and strike. Online education is fast becoming a lifeline for our schools. Earlier, Ezekwesili, who is also a member of the University’s Advisory Board, noted that public-private partnership in Nigeria’s education sector has become imperative.
