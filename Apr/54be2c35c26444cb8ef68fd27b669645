The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has officially begun registration of candidates for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) into tertiary institutions. The announcement came barely 48 hours after it had suspended the exercise over technical challenges of the National Identification Number (NIN).

Registration is now in full swing,” he said, adding that some candidates had successfully registered for the examination. The tests were originally billed for last Thursday before the suspension prompted by NIN integration hitches. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
