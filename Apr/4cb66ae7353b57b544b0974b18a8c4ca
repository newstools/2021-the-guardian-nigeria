Young Men Christian Association (YMCA) of Lagos has donated boreholes to residents of Powerline Unity Estate, Ikorodu and Majiyagbe Layout, Ipaja, all in Lagos. The Vice Chairman, YMCA Lagos, Adedolapo Ayoola, said the association wants to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Six that talks about includng clean water and sanitation by 2030. He said most of the communities in Lagos lacked access to clean and portable water, adding thatthe association provided boreholes for Ikorodu and Ipaja residents to end the challenge of water. “We discovered that most communities in Lagos don’t have access to clean water. So, we have to, in our own little way, address this challenge by providing these boreholes to Powerline Estate in Ikorodu and Majiagbe Layout in Ipaja,” he said. The chairman, Powerline Unity Estate Community Development Association (CDA), Kola Odubiyi, said the project was laudable, adding that water is very essential to human survival in the community. The Secretary YMCA, Ipaja, Biodun Egunjobi, said the project would alleviate the suffering of Ipaja residents in terms of getting clean and safe water. He added that about 600 people at Majiagbe community would benefit from the project when fully operational. A tenant of Maijiagbe community, Folorunsho Aderemi Adeniyi, commended the project, saying clean water is essential to survival just as food is prime to human existence. He said: “If you are planning to build a property, the first thing is how to provide water because you need water to build a house and to survive as owners of the property. “It is tremendous that the association thought of water as their corporate social responsibility priority. Water is key for life. We need to provide clean and quality water for people to survive and this project is highly recommended and applauded.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
