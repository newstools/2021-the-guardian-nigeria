We know nothing about it, says aide
Barely two years to the 2023 presidential election, campaign posters announcing the presidential aspiration of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, have flooded streets of Abuja. Saraki came third behind Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar (the eventual winner), in the 2018 presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. That election featured heavyweight politicians, including former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso; former President of the Senate, David Mark; and former governor of Sokoto, Attahiru Bafarawa. At the Wadata Plaza, headquarters of PDP, Saraki is seen smiling in campaign posters with the inscription, ‘Reset Nigeria 2023: Vote Abubakar Bukola Saraki as President.’ When called by The Guardian for reaction, his media aide, Yusuf Olaniyonu, said they knew nothing about the posters. “We do not know anything about the posters. We are ignoring it,” Olaniyonu said. Saraki is the Chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee set up by the National Working Committee (NWC) to reconcile aggrieved members and woo new members into its fold ahead of the 2023 general elections.
