In a bid to empower the next generation of creatives, Audiomack is donating $5000 worth of tablets and headsets that will support the Slum2School initiative in Africa, a volunteer-driven development organization empowering underserved children in slums and remote communities with quality education, entrepreneurial skills, and psychosocial support to enable them realize their full potential and become social reformers. These funds will go towards supporting 38 learners with tablets in the virtual learning program, which was designed to combat the impact of COVID-19 on education in disadvantaged communities in Nigeria. Speaking about the initiative, Charlotte Bwana, Head of Business Development and Media Partnerships, Audiomack Africa, reiterated their commitment to empowering their host communities. She said while the pandemic has impacted all aspects of our lives including the education sector, they recognize the increased gap on children from underprivileged communities, as they are unable to access quality education and learning materials. She said the donation demonstrates their efforts to bridge this gap because they are committed to fostering a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper. Otto Orondaam, Founder of Slum2School Africa said they are glad to collaborate with Audiomack who share in their vision to transform society by empowering underserved children in slums and remote communities with quality education. He called on individuals and organizations to support the cause and help make an impact in Nigeriaâ€™s educational development.
