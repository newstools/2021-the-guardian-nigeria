But Lavrov stressed it was important “not to switch to the other extreme which we saw during the ‘BLM’ (Black Lives Matter) events and the aggression against white people, white US citizens.” Founded in the United States in 2013, Black Lives Matter is a movement which became a rallying cry after the killing by US police of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, last May. The movement has led to a major debate about race, rights of people of colour and the toppling of statues of figures linked to slavery or colonisation in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. Lavrov accused the United States of seeking to spread what he called “a cultural revolution” around the world. “They have colossal possibilities for it,” he said in the interview. “Hollywood is now also changing its rules so that everything reflects the diversity of modern society,” he said, calling that “a form of censorship.” “I’ve seen Black people play in Shakespeare’s comedies. Only I don’t know when there will be a white Othello,” Lavrov said. “You see this is absurd. Political correctness taken to the point of absurdity will not end well.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
