Nigeria Prison The Public Relations Officer, Bauchi State Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), Adam Abubakar Jibrin, yesterday, said all the inmates who attempted to escape during the jail-break in Bauchi have been returned to their cells, revealing that the command discovered that one of the staff was smuggling prohibited substances into the Centre for the inmates. He said: “Yes, there was a little problem in the Custodian Centre. We have gone there and I can tell you that everything has been brought back to normal. “It was discovered that one of the staff was smuggling prohibited substances into the Centre for the inmates. He was caught and tried by the authorities. Some of the inmates who were getting the items felt bad and decided to protest the NCS’s action. “Also, we have some inmates from the Southern part of the country who were aware of the happenings in Owerri. So, they teamed up with those protesting the stop of the supply and attempted a jailbreak.” Police operatives have since barricaded the roads leading to the centre. Five Police vans and one vehicle belonging to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were sighted at the scene.
