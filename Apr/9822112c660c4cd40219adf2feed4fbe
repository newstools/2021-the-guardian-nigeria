Meanwhile anyone already in Italy who had been in India in the past 14 days should contact health authorities, he added. With a new coronavirus variant spreading through its 1.3 billion people, India has become the world’s top coronavirus hotspot in recent days, reporting 349,691 new cases on Sunday alone. In the past week, more than two million cases have been detected, a 58-percent increase on the previous seven days, according to figures compiled by AFP.
