Team Lagos yesterday progressed to three finals of the boxing event out of four semifinals bouts at the ongoing Edo 2020 National Sports Festival. The contests were held at the Oba Akenzua Cultural Centre Benin, Edo State.
 
Fighting in the 69kg, Lagos’ Oraekwe Blessing defeated Team Imo’s Oben Blessing via knock out to move to the final bout for the gold medal, while Fatimo Aromokola of Lagos State triumphed over Team Edo Toyin Adejumola on points 4-1, as Francis Gabriel overwhelmed Kelvin Kpuluzu of Edo State by four points to one in an interesting bout.
 
However, Olamide Mustapha could not join the rest of his team as he lost to Alade Oluwatobi of Ekiti State, in the 60kg.
