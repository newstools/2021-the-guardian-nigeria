The Abia State Government and the security agencies have promised that the nature and source or sources of some suspected devices found at a primary school in Afara Ukwu in Umuahia North Local Council are being investigated. The state’s Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, disclosed this, yesterday, in a statement. He said: “While initial examination of the devices showed evidence of corrosion leading to suspicion of the materials being relics of the civil war era, we are awaiting definite official report from the Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Squad of the Nigeria Police, who are currently investigating the incident.” He said that necessary measures had been taken to protect the pupils and members of staff of the school, adding that security sweeps were ongoing while the school was temporarily closed. According to him, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has directed security agencies to embark on proactive checks in other vulnerable locations out of abundance of caution. He, therefore, urged citizens and residents of the state to continue to maintain vigilance and report suspicious situations to security agents and thanked God that there was no harm to life and property.
