The Youth and Sports Development Ministry has revealed plans to revamp the National Sports Festival (NSF) to keep it in line with modern realities. The recent edition of the National Sports Festival was held in Benin City, Edo State, early this month. According to the sports ministry, the committee for the review, which will be along the lines of strengthening the games, athletes’ protection and template for bidding among other things, will soon be announced. Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare, during his recent visit on Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, said, “There is a new template for the NSF, which will have a 360 geopolitical spread. This spread will be introduced such that we move it for the northwest zone to bid this year and two years later it goes to the southwest so that it moves around the whole country.” He believes changing the template is the only way to avoid the scenario of back to back hosting of the games, within the same geo political zone. Dare said: “The terms of reference for a committee to review the National Sports Festival will be stated clearly and we would look at how to further strengthen the NSF for better sports development. “We have started the process and next week we will announce the review committee.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
