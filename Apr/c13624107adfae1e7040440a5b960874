The Globacom-powered African Voices on CNN International is set to highlight the impact of two sports icons Tendai Mtawarira from Zimbabwe and Kenya’s Humphrey Kayange as change agents in their respective countries this weekend. The duo, former rugby players, will be special guests on the programme, and will share with viewers their on-and-off-the-pitch activities and accomplishments. Kayange, who was born in 1982, studied Organic Chemistry at the Jomo Kenyatta University, Juja, Kenya, before starting a career in rugby. He also runs the Atlas Foundation, a platform for mentoring and advocating for Kenyan athletes and young sports prospects in the country. Mtawarira started playing rugby for South Africa in 2008 and is the most capped prop in South Africa as well as the third most-capped Springbok of all time. He set up the Beast Foundation in 2020 for enthusiastic young people who aspire to find their feet in sports and education. The program will be on CNN on DSTV Channel 401 on Saturday at 9.30 a.m. and repeat editions will run on Sunday at 4.30 a.m., 7.30 a.m., 12.30 p.m., 7.30 p.m. and on Monday at 5.30 a.m. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
