The Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) has named Ogun State Governor, Mr. Dapo Abiodun, as the special guest of honour at the upcoming 2020/21 NWFL Premiership Super Six competition billed to hold from April 19 to 25, 2021 at the Otunba Dipo Dina International Stadium, Ijebu-Ode. The elite football showpiece will confirm the league champions and confer ticket on the team to represent the country at the maiden CAF Women’s Champions League later in the year. Teams for the Super Six Championship are Bayelsa Queens, Delta Queens, Rivers Angels, Edo Queens, FC Robo Queens and Sunshine Queens. After 13 weeks of action packed league competition, Bayelsa Queens showed class by leading the 14-team top-flight with 31 points, two ahead closest challengers and neighbours, Delta Queens. Rivers Angels closed up on the third spot on 28 points, and Edo Queens and FC Robo Queens came strongly on 23 and 22 points respectively. Sunshine Queens have to endure a harrowing wait for the last matchday clash against former champions, Nasarawa Amazons, to confirm her claim to the last Super Six ticket. Governor Abiodun is expected to lead other dignitaries within and outside the government circle to grace and drum supports for the football feast as well as the women’s game generally. The Aisha Falode-led NWFL board has promised that only the best will be good enough to hoist the nation’s flag at the continent by providing a level playing ground to the teams to showcase their individual football artistry.
