 Team Lagos girls applauding the fans after beating Team Kaduna 4-0 in the football event of the on-going National Sports Festival… at the weekend  In the second semifinal played on Saturday, Kano surprisingly lost to Bayelsa, who booked a date with Lagos. With just five teams in the men’s category, the competition is being played in a round-robin format. Gombe looks good for the gold medal with an unbeaten streak after three games against Kano, Edo and Kwara states. After just a game against Kwara, which they won conveniently by 103 to 52 points, Lagos also has been tipped for a medal finish with three more games against Edo, Kano and Gombe states.
