Apples. Photo Chowhound The habit of eating fruits frequently can help to keep the body system normalised and healthy. Nutritionists report that certain fruits can help enhance the wellbeing of hormones in the human body, which in turn, caters to some organs. This includes the heart, eyes, liver and kidney, amongst others. The vagina is not left out. Natural lubrication of the vagina is highly driven by the hormone oestrogen and functions as an important factor in both intimate intercourse and vaginal health. However, the vagina is a self-protector and cleanser of its insides, which means the vagina is good at cleaning and protecting itself from external factors that can lead to vaginal dryness. When the oestrogen levels of the female genital are low, it can result in making the vaginal tissue fragile, thin and dry, making sexual intercourse painful and less enjoyable. The usage of lubricant products can help with vaginal dryness, but elements found in some lubricants can take away the natural moisture and make the dryness worse. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use lubes that enhance vaginal hydration. Nonetheless, taking natural healthy measures to maintain vagina wellness is recommended. Here are 5 fruits that can help achieve that 1. Apple
The vitamins in an apple helps to boost sexual pleasure in women. According to a study in 2014, stated by Healthline, women who ate an apple at least once a day had a better sex drive. The phytoestrogen Phoridzin found in apples is presumed to serve as an enhancer for better sex functionality, lubrication, arousal and ability to orgasm. Scientist suggests that the compound phloridzin found inside an apple is like the female sex hormone oestradiol. This hormone plays a major role in sexual arousal. Researchers from Santa Chiara Regional Hospital in Trento, Italy are of the opinion that the more apples a woman ingests, the higher the level of sexual function and lubrication, an evaluation which takes into account all-inclusive satisfaction with sex. More so, an apple contains antioxidants which serve as an aid to stimulate blood flow to the vagina. This causes the body to experience intimate pleasure and finally orgasm.
