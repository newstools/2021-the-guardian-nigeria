The Ondo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality and Other Related Matters, yesterday, submitted its report, urging Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to pay N755.7 million as compensation to petitioners. Chairman of the panel, Justice Adesola Sidiq (rtd), while submitting the report to the governor in his office in Akure, said the panel received 77 petitions from public and private persons, including organisations. He added that the panel heard 14 criminal and 63 civil matters in the petitions while property were vandalised in Akure South, Ondo West, Odigbo and Okitipupa local councils. Aside from payment of the N755 million, the panel also recommended publication of apologies in national dailies, particularly where the reputation of victims had been tarnished. Justice Sidiq: “The disheartening aspect of the assignment bordered on human rights violation, which dates as far back as 2003 and unfortunately remained unresolved until this panel was set up.” He urged review of Section 84 of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act (2004) to enable judgment creditors enjoy the fruit of their litigations. Akeredolu, who lauded the committee for doing a thorough job, said the administration would do justice to the report. The governor said: “ENDSARS was a legitimate protest but it got to a point where hoodlums hijacked it. The destruction of property was not done by #ENDSARS protesters. #ENDSARS was not about setting buildings ablaze like the Aketi campaign office. Those are political matters. People wanting to settle scores. “When we go through your report, we will see how you want us to spend N755 million. We will look at it again. Where politicians set each other buildings’ ablaze, each person will bear the cost.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
