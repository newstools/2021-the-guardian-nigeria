Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has urged Nigerians, particularly residents of the state, not to be discouraged by the prevailing security, economic and social challenges confronting the nation, but be steadfast in prayers for the country. The governor equally urged the people to be cautious and avoid using inflammatory words capable of causing disunity in the country.
Abiodun gave the admonition, yesterday, at the 13th yearly Synod of the Methodist Church, Nigeria, Diocese of Remo Central, held at the Methodist Church, Oke-Oja, Isara-Remo in Remo North Local Council of the state. According to him, conflicts are inevitable in any human society, but Nigerians, as a people, must always look for amicable ways to resolve such conflicts whenever they arise. He acknowledged that though there is fear in the land as a result of insecurity, Nigerians must continue praying for the nation and the leaders, saying: “Prayers can never be enough.” Abiodun, who noted the interplay between the theme of the synod, “Watch and Pray,” said the theme sufficed as prayer was capable of upturning unpleasant situations to pleasant ones. He lauded the adherents of different religions for maintaining peaceful co-existence in the state, saying that the administration had received inspirations from religious leaders calling for more support and prayers. In his remark, the Diocesan Bishop of Remo Central, Rt. Rev. Olu Akinola, urged the governor to always be attentive and spend quality time with God. He further commended the governor for his achievements in provision of roads, housing, security and employment, noting that “these have helped in improving the well-being of the people.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
