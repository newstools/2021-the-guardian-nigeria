 [FILES] Buhari. Photo: TWITTER/NIGERIAGOV  The concern was raised by renowned activist and critic, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, in a statement, yesterday, in Lagos, where he advised President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently address the country over incessant agitations for self-determination and restructuring. “Nigerians are now restless over bad governance and insecurity in the country. They are now hopeless more than before. Where there is no justice and fair play, certainly there will be no peace. The loud agitations are genuine and sincere, which cannot be ignored, “ he said. Onitiri said the empathy of the presidency can no longer be tolerated, advising the Federal Government against pushing Nigerians out of tolerable limits as the consequences might be unpalatable and disastrous to the whole of Africa. He said: “For the umpteen time, Nigerians are calling on the President to stop external borrowings, but look inwards and cut down on the cost of governance. There is poverty in the land, coupled with insensitive leadership. Our country is fast sliding into a failed nation. “The present administration has completely failed the nation in the area of security, economy, and fight against corruption, which it promised on the assumption of office.  Anarchy is looming with our restive youths because of unemployment and economic hardship. There seems to be no solution in sight.” The socio-political activist called on all past leaders to prevail on Buhari to address the nation and stop “this slide to anarchy and disaster fast enveloping the country. A stitch in time saves nine.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
