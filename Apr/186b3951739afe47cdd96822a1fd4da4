Air Peace To cushion the shortfall in local fleet capacity, Air Peace airline has deployed one of its wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft to local routes. The Guardian learnt that the unusual move was to meet the travel needs of travellers during the Easter period. The spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said the jumbo aircraft had been specifically deployed to operate the Lagos-Enugu-Lagos and Abuja-Enugu-Abuja routes during the festive season. “He added that customers will have international flight experience on domestic routes while flying the state-of-the-art B777 aircraft with enhanced comfort, style and luxury.” Chairman of the airline, Allen Onyema, had complained that the industry faces flight disruptions over low capacity rocking the airlines. Onyema, said the sector could have shut down weeks ago, but for the intervention of the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika. He said Air Peace and all other local operators are back at the brink, with only very few of the available airplanes currently in operation. He noted that though Air Peace had the largest fleet of 27 airplanes in the country, only about five are in operations, while 17 are stuck in maintenance facilities overseas due to COVID-19 and lockdown challenges. Recall that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) lately shut down operations of Azman Air over alleged safety concerns, which are partly related to maintenance constraints experienced by the carrier.
