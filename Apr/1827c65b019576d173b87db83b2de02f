“Let us hope that the spirit of humanity and unity bringing different sectors together at this summit will be an example for the international community everywhere.” Chairman, Department of Health – Abu Dhabi, H.E. Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Hamed, in his opening address, said since last year, the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to be one of the largest and most complex global challenges in modern times, noting that it’s still incredible how the world has come together to tackle the issue that transcends communities, borders, and continents. Discussing the resilience and success that the world has shown, the Chairman said there are incredible technology and scientific advancements that have been developed as a result of the pandemic, adding that under one unified goal, countries around the world are working tirelessly to find solutions.
 
Speaking on the achievements of Abu Dhabi and the HOPE Consortium, Abdullah explained: “We strongly believe no one can do this alone. Together, we have the capacity to handle over six billion doses of the vaccine this year, and we are already increasing this to deliver over 18 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with the capacity to deliver this anywhere in the world. We believe the HOPE Consortium is a catalyst for even greater collaboration with partners worldwide.” A range of experts, including Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire; Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Health, Republic of Kenya, Sen.
