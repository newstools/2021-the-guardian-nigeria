As part of activities marking the 69th birthday of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bola Tinubu, gift items were donated to orphanages across Lagos and Ogun states by the Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) Foundation. The donations, which were facilitated by the Speaker of Lagos House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, were handed out by the BAT Director-General, Ahmed Omisore, in the company of the foundation’s Director of Media, Mobolaji Sanusi. Speaking at the orphanages, Omisore said the donation was to demonstrate the love and kindness of Asiwaju Tinubu towards the underprivileged, adding that it was an extension of his humanitarian gesture to the needy in the society. Omisore said the donation of the food items to the orphanages was one of the segments of the donations to be made by the foundation, which, he said, would be in batches. He promised that other needy people would be identified in the society across the nation to be reached by the foundation. According to the Director of Media, Mobolaji Sanusi, some of the orphanages reached included Little Saints Orphanage, Abule-Egba; SOS Children Village, Isolo, and Ijamido Children’s Home (Willoughby’s Home), Ota.
