• Edo Queens’ Coach Apologises After Fourth Defeat The Chairman of Delta State Sports Commission, Chief Tonobok Okowa yesterday charged players and coaches of Delta Queens FC to protect their chances of appearing in the maiden CAF Champions League. The Asaba girls drew 0-0 against already eliminated Bayelsa Queens at the on-going NWFL Super Six contest in Ijebu-Ode yesterday on a day Rivers Angels revived their CAF Champions League chances with a 4-0 win against Edo Queens. Both Rivers Angels and Delta Queens have eight points. Delta Queens, who won their opening game against Edo Queens to jump to the top of the table, are now in second position behind River Angels. The Asaba girls will face RC Robo in their last match tomorrow. The Lagos based team (FC Robo), fell 0-1 to Sunshine Queens of Akure yesterday to surrender their leadership of the table to Rivers Angels. The defeat might cost FC Robo the dream of playing in the CAF Champions League. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Okowa stated that Delta Queens had what it takes to pick the CAF Champions League ticket, but cautioned the girls to face FC Robo with seriousness and determination. “Delta Queens FC have to approach the game against FC Robo on Sunday (today) with all seriousness. Irrespective of their defeat to Sunshine Queens, FC Robo is a high-flying side. I am sure Delta Queens will get the ticket,” Okowa stated. Meanwhile, Edo Queens continued their abysmal form at the Super Six yesterday, as they lost 0-4 to Rivers Angels. The four defeat in four matches means that Edo Queens will not be part of the country’s representatives at the WAFU qualifiers, which precedes the maiden edition of the CAF Women’s champions league later in the year, in Morocco. Coach Osaze Stanley regretted the woeful results which according to him wasn’t part of their plans. “This is not our plan, not our thinking, not part of our preparations; it has happened and there’s nothing we can do about it, we will take it like that as football, but four loses in four for us is very bad, it’s terrible and we are pained, but we have to move ahead.” “We got it all wrong, the players, the technical team, but I as the head coach is taking the blame.” Coach Stanley however expressed his happiness, believing the poor outing will serve as eyes opener to work on lapses of the team. “The bad news is that we lost out, but the good news is that we have seen a lot to work on as a team in preparations for the Aiteo cup.” The former Coach of Bendel Insurance Feeders team apologised to the government and people of Edo State, promising a better outing in the future “We owe the government and people of Edo a lot of apology. We are really sorry for this huge disappointment. This is not our plan, we hope to get it right in the nearest future,” Stanley stated. The Obaseki girls will battle Bayelsa Queens tomorrow morning, in a face saving match which could be a must win for their opponents.
