The All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 150.13 absolute points, representing a decrease of 0.39 per cent to close at 38,766.61 points while the overall market capitalisation value lost N78 billion to close at N20.283 trillion. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are Guinness Nigeria, MRS Oil Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, BUA Cement, and Aluminium Extrusion Industries. For the week, United Capital Plc said: “We retain a mid-term bearish outlook on the market particularly as the ASI struggled to hold above the 39,000 points support in the prior week. We expect a sustained reversal in yields to remain a threat to any form of a sustained rebound in the equities market.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment turned negative, as 21 stocks lost relative to 14 gainers. Eterna Plc recorded the highest price gain of 9.91 per cent to close at N5.99 kobo.

Speaking at the Closing Gong Ceremony, the Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc, Otunba Abimbola Ogunbanjo said: “It is impossible to overstate Oscar Onyema’s contributions to the growth of the exchange and the development of the capital market in the past ten years. After his first year of leadership, it became evident that his strategic mindset and mastery of Exchange business was what NSE dearly needed to rise to its next level of growth. “As anticipated, the exchange went on to experience significant growth as the years went by, most notable of which is the recent completion of the demutualisation of the exchange. It has indeed been a pleasure working with him in our time at the NSE and I look forward to our continued journey to greatness in the NGX era.” Onyema said: “I arrived at the NSE when the stock market was in the doldrums, investors’ confidence low, mono-product, and the bourse under regulatory administration.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
