Clarification over variance in Covishield vaccine dose administration in some counties.  National taskforce on Vaccine Deployment & Vaccinations says variance attributed to decision by some manufacturers to include some overage or extra quantity in a vial to cater for losses when vaccines are being drawn into syringes. Each Covishield vaccine vial contains 10 doses.  Depending on the type of syringes used, the remaining quantity in the vial may yield one or two extra doses. Taskforce says the same has been observed during use of the Covishield vaccine in Kenya.  The experience has been observed in other countries conducting COVID-19 Vaccination, such as the USA, due to the use of low dead volume syringes. This in effect leads to a negative wastage rate where more people are vaccinated from one vial than the expected number of doses.  According to the taskforce, Wastage of the vaccines is expected to vary from facility to facility and county to county. Kenya is targeting an average wastage rate of 10% or less to cater for both areas with low wastage and those with high wastage. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Ministry of Health, Kenya.
