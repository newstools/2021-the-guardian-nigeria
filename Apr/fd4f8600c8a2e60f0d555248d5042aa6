A CHIEFTAIN of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Chekwas Okorie, has warned his party against imposition of candidate in the November 6, 2021 governorship election in Anambra State. National Chairman of the defunct United Progressives Party (UPP), who spoke yesterday at an event to present over 1000 members and the state party structure of his former party in support of a frontline aspirant, Chief Azuka Okwuosa, at his campaign office in Awka, advised stalwarts to work hard for victory at the poll. Okorie pointed out that the emergence of an Igbo president in 2023 strongly depended on the outcome of the forthcoming gubernatorial contest. He said: “We shall resist any attempt by some people to impose a candidate on the APC. We insist on democratic process, and will not accept any written result from Abuja. We must ensure that internal democracy prevails in Anambra APC. “The 2021 Anambra election is very important to Igbo nation. The South East and Ndigbo in general getting the presidency in 2023 depends on the outcome of Anambra governorship election. It is a serious assignment.” Responding, Okwuosa promised to reposition the state if voted into office, restating that his mandate was to work for the interest of Ndigbo and Nigeria in general. He decried a situation where those who worked, suffered and made sacrifice for the party were not getting commensurate reward after election victory, to promising integrate members of the UPP into his campaign structure. “I am very close to Okorie. I have worked with him when we were formerly in APGA. People listen to him and he occupies a high place in APC national level,” he added.
