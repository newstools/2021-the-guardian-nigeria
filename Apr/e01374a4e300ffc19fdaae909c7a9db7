Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Candido, has decried the implications of the lingering conflicts between the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) and AMAC on his programmes and activities. Speaking yesterday in Abuja, Candido stated that the development has made things difficult for his administration to meet obligations to the people. There have been conflicting claims between FCTA and AMAC over the body empowered by law to collect certain taxes, especially tenement rates in the city centre with Candido insisting that the entire city centre, including the very space where FCTA office is located, fall within AMAC’s jurisdiction. Blaming the power tussle on some vested interests bent on undermining the provision of the law in order to frustrate his administration’s commitment to delivering dividends of democracy, he vowed not to stand aside while development eludes his people. He says he fears that he may not live up to the people’s expectations if he remains indifferent to the issue of tenement rate’s collection. He insisted that he was ready to defend what belongs to his Area Council “even if it is going to cost me this position”, as according to him, certain areas were statutorily, the responsibility of AMAC and not FCTA. He also admonished the person coming after him to sit up so as not to be denied their rights. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
