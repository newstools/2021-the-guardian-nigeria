The organisation said that Europe’s virus situation was “more worrying than we have seen in several months.” Five weeks ago, the weekly number of new cases in Europe had dipped to under one million, but “last week saw increasing transmission of Covid-19 in the majority of countries in the WHO European region, with 1.6 million new cases,” it said. The total number of deaths in Europe “is fast approaching one million and the total number of cases about to surpass 45 million,” it said. The WHO’s European region comprises 53 countries and territories and includes Russia and several Central Asian nations. The organisation warned that the rapid spread of the virus could increase the risk of new variants of concern developing. “The likelihood of new variants of concern occurring increases with the rate at which the virus is replicating and spreading, so curbing transmission through basic disease control actions is crucial,” Dorit Nitzan, WHO Europe’s regional emergency director, said in the statement.
