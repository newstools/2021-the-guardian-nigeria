 From left, Governors Bello Matawalle (Zamfara), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), former Senate President and Chairman of the PDP Reconciliation Committee, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, former Senate President, Pius Anyim, former governor of Cross River, Liyel Imoke, former Governor of Katsina, Ibrahim Shema and former Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo, at a meeting between the Reconciliation Committee and PDP Governors Forum, held at the Sokoto State Government Lodge in Asokoro, Abuja.<br />  Regional state-actors have a duty to shelve political divides, summon collective resistance and deliver their people from sponsored terrorism, given, as it were, that the federal government has failed to secure the citizens. How else can one lament the situation in those two regions where law enforcement agents, including soldiers, are waylaid and freely executed for months without anyone being arrested or prosecuted? All that follows each orgy of death is wailing and condemnation by the authorities. The governors actually indicated, at their last meeting in Abuja under the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) that but for their intervention, criminality in their domain could have been worse. Even if that is so, Nigerians in those affected regions will settle for no less than peace and freedom to live their lives normally. They have effectively been deprived of these simple attributes for too long and with no respite in view.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
