Many groups have been campaigning for Tinubu, who governed Lagos between 1999 and 2007, to run for the country’s highest office, but the man known as ‘Jagaban’ has not come out officially to declare his interest in the job. Consequently, Ngilari urged northern leaders to rally round the South West for the next president in 2023, “in the spirit of equity and fair play.” The Adamawa former governor, who spoke to reporters shorty after security summit by Adamawa youths, said: “Conceding power to the South West will strengthen the unity of the county.” Speaking in the same vein, Lawal posited that the presidency should be narrowed to the South West by the APC because of the role played by Tinubu and the party’s pioneer chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, in the party. The duo argued that “Tinubu has paid his dues” and ought to be encouraged to vie for the exalted seat. According to Ngilari, during the formation of the party, there was a gentlemen’s agreement reached with the South West leaders of the party to produce the next president after President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Ngilari was of the view that “power should shift to the south since north has spent eight years. for equity and fair play.” He was optimistic that if APC fields Tinubu for the 2023 polls, it would sweep the polls, judging with recent performance of the party in local councils of the state. Also, Lawal noted that Tinubu and Akande made the Buhari presidency possible. In another development, Ngilari said the state was more secure and united when he held sway in 2015. During a town hall meeting in Yola at the weekend Ngilari described his style of leadership as unique and straightforward. APC, he added, has learnt serious lesson, hence the need for the party to work together for victory in the 2023 elections. He recalled how he managed, to the appreciation of all, the farmers/herders’ clashes in the state.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
