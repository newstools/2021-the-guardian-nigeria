The Sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos, Commander Olusegun Ogungbemide, on Wednesday, admonished motorists driving with temporary driver’s licences in Lagos to pick up their permanent ones. Ogungbemide, in a statement signed by FRSC Public Education Officer, Route Commander, Olabisi Sonusi, lamented the huge number of permanent driver’s license lying fallow at various capturing centres, and said the appeal had become necessary to offload all uncollected licences. According to him, there are no fewer than 55,501 unclaimed permanent driver’s licences across the state, the corps was making frantic efforts by phone calls to applicants as a form of encouragement towards picking up their permanent driver’s licence. He said that the command would observe the responses of applicants for few days before commencing operation to clamp down on those still driving with the temporary driver’s licence. Ogungbemide said the National Road Traffic Regulations 2012 Section 67 (1) states that “Any person driving a vehicle on any public road shall be in possession of an original driver’s licence, but where the person is in possession of the photocopy of the original driver’s licence, he shall within 24 hours produce the original driver’s licence to the appropriate authority if demanded.” He urged motorists to be concerned about the very important driving document, and added that the command would not leave any stone unturned to sanitise the road.
