For GQ’s May issue, Bieber, 27, revealed that it got to such a low point that security guards would sneak into his bedroom in the middle of the night and check his pulse to make sure he was still alive. “There was a sense of still yearning for more,” he recalled. “It was like I had all this success and it was still like: ‘I’m still sad, and I’m still in pain. And I still have these unresolved issues.’ And I thought all the success was going to make everything good. “And so for me, the drugs were a numbing agent to just continue to get through.” Justin Bieber | Image: The Independent UK Bieber said he “lost control” of his vision for his career. The pop star continued: “There’s all these opinions. And in this industry, you’ve got people that unfortunately prey on people’s insecurities and use that to their benefit. And so when that happens, obviously that makes you angry. And then you’re this young angry person who had these big dreams, and then the world just jades you and makes you into this person that you don’t want to be. And then you wake up one day and your relationships are f—– up and you’re unhappy and you have all this success in the world, but you’re just like: Well, what is this worth if I’m still feeling empty inside?” Bieber added that his wife, Hailey Bieber, helped him to get through these dark moments though admittedly “their first year of marriage was really tough because there was a lot going back to the trauma.” Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin | Photo: Healthy Topics “There was just a lack of trust,” Bieber remembered. “There was all these things that you don’t want to admit to the person that you’re with, because it’s scary. You don’t want to scare them off by saying, ‘I’m scared.'”
