He said one of the bogus handles, @AbdulRashidBaw1, created in February after Bawa’s appointment as the nation’s chief anti-graft czar, had witnessed a steady stream of followers, indicating that many had been hoodwinked into believing they were dealing with the EFCC chair. Uwujaren clarified: “Against this background, it is imperative to again warn that these Twitter accounts are fake and have no link whatsoever with Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, Executive Chairman of the EFCC.” “Those following the fake Twitter accounts are therefore doing so at their own risk.” He added: “In the same vein, the commission wished to remind the promoters of the fake Twitter accounts that their actions amounted to impersonation or identity theft punishable under the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc.) Act 2015. “They are warned to desist or risk the full wrath of the law.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
