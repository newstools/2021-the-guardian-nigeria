Former Golden Eaglet, Abba Bichi, has reiterated his resolve to continue championing charity works for the good of teeming Nigerian kids and youths. Bichi, who is reputed for his charity work in Nigeria, says he won’t shy away from giving back to the society. The football star founded the ABBA Bichi Eye Care Foundation, which takes care of the poor and less privileged. He also owns three football academies located in Kano, Sokoto and Abuja, from where he expects the next generation of footballers would be groomed. Speaking on his charity works, Bichi said:   “It is my own modest way of contributing to the well-being of less privileged Nigerians, most of who look up to well placed individuals in the country for succour.” Unlike some other Nigerian footballers, both active and retired, who used soccer to get out of poverty, Bichi falls in the bracket of a rich kid from a rich and privileged family background.  He is son of the current Director General of State Security Service (DSS), Yusuf Bichi. Despite coming from a rich and famous home, Bichi’s lifestyle is simple and easy. He made his international debut in Brazil with the Golden Eaglets some years ago. Bichi, who says he has fallen in love with Brazilian superstar, Neymar, and has adopted his style of play, also wants to pattern his game around that of Portuguese captain, Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentine maestro, Lionel Messi. Bichi says he got his pace from Ronald, dribbling from Neymar and passes, vision, awareness with high intelligence from Messi. Aware that footballers don’t have all the years to remain in the limelight, Bichi says he is already planning for life after retirement. He owns a sports-based brand, Bichi Jr brand, consisting of hoodies, shirts, shorts and slides.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
