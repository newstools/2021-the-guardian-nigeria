The Elewu of Ewu-Ekiti, Ilejemeje Local Council, Oba Adetutu Ajayi narrowly escaped death on Friday evening, as suspected gunmen rained bullets on his car. Though the monarch escaped death, he sustained gunshot injuries and was taken to a medical facility where he is receiving treatment. A source in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, said the monarch was travelling in his official car to the neighbouring Ayetoro-Ekiti, Ido/Osi Local Council, when the gunmen struck. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Sunday Abutu, regretted that the incident happened in spite of the rigorous joint patrol operation, raiding of black spots and combing of forests by the Police to dislodge criminals. Abutu said the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Babatunde Mobayo’s directive that the combined forces of police, Amotekun Corps, vigilance groups, local hunters, chiefs, drivers’ union, motorcycle riders, farmers and other stakeholders should carry out a joint operation was being diligently observed simultaneously across the 16 local councils when the gunmen struck. “The operation was aimed at dislodging and apprehending the miscreants in their hideouts as directed by the Commissioner of Police.” He added that the CP assured the public that the perpetrators would be brought to book, pledging that the command shall continue to work with relevant security outfits, ministries, stakeholders and organisations to ensure that criminality is wiped out in Ekiti.
