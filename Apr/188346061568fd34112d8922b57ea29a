Homicide detectives of the Lagos State Police Command are now investigating Anthony Ikpeama, who allegedly killed his wife by removing her oxygen on admission bed at Doyen Hospital, Ajah, Lagos State. He was transferred to the homicide section of the state Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, for thorough investigation. Lagos State police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, told newsmen that the suspect had not been released, contrary to the rumour making the rounds on the social media. “It is a capital offense and the police will not grant him any administrative bail for whatever reason. The matter is on and we will do justice to the case as expected.” Mrs Destiny Adaeze Ikpeama, a lawyer, was reportedly six months pregnant when she was allegedly beaten into a coma by her husband, Anthony Ikpeama, in their Ajah home and was rushed to hospital where she was fitted with an oxygen mask. The police said Ikpeama allegedly unplugged the oxygen mask, leading to the wife’s death at the weekend. It was gathered that a report was immediately filed at the Ajah Police Station while the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone II, Onikan, Ahmed Iliyasu, was also contacted for assistance by some of the lawyers. It was gathered that with the help of the AIG, detectives were deployed to fish out the suspect from his hideout where he was arrested around 2.a.m. yesterday. Spokesman for the zonal command, DSP Hauwa Adamu-Idris, confirmed the suspect and the complainants were at the zonal headquarters. “The AIG has directed that the case be transferred to the Lagos Police Command for thorough investigation and further action,” she said.
