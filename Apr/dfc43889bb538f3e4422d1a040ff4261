At the close of trading, the All-Share Index (ASI) dropped by 524.00 absolute points, representing a decline of 1.33 per cent to close at 38,781.48 points while the overall market capitalisation value lost N274 billion to close at N20.296 trillion. The downturn was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; Guinness Nigeria, International Breweries, Ardova Plc, PZ Cussons Nigeria and UAC of Nigeria (UACN). Analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “With market breadth swinging into negative territory and activity levels subdued, we foresee another mixed session. We also note the possibility of further profit-taking on the recent gainers in the banking space.” The market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was negative, as 23 stocks declined, relative to 20 gainers.
