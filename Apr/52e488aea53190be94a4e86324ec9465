The University of Port Harcourt management has denied allegations that a final year student in the Faculty of Agriculture, Adeleye Adeola Gloria, died few days after writing her first semester examinations in the university. The female student was reported to have collapsed in her room and died on Wednesday, April 7, 2021 after writing exams.	But confirming the incident, the Public Relations Officer of the University, Sam Kpenu, said the student had rounded off her exams, went back to Lagos where her family resides, reunited with them before her sudden death. Kpenu said while the university community commiserated with Gloria’s family over her sudden demise, the institution had a modern health facility with competent professionals where drugs and health care services were offered to students for free. He described as false the report that the student died as a result of “school stress” from exams. He said: “Exams timetables are spaced to ensure they do not affect the students in any way. Besides, we finished the first semester exams since last week to resume again on Monday.” Speaking further, Kpenu said: “The University of Port Harcourt has a solid health facility with renowned professionals where health care services are offered to students for free, even students who do not reside inside the university community come and receive similar care for free. So, we are very concern about the health of all our students.” He, however, advised students to always visit the health centre whenever they are feeling sick.
