 [FILES] Kano-Pillars  Musa, who first made his debut for the Kano-based team as a 16-year-old before leaving for a long sojourn in European football, made the headlines last week when his decision to rejoin the team on a short contract was announced. But the Super Eagles captain may not get the captain’s armband, which is currently held by veteran midfielder, Rabiu Ali. Kano Pillars Media Officer, Idris Malikawa, told The Guardian at the weekend that the decision on who captains the team during Musa’s short stay with the club depends on the coaches and players of the club. He noted that the former CSKA Moscow FC of Russia and Leicester City of England player presence in Kano Pillars would boost the morale of the other players as the team seeks to win the NPFL trophy this year. Malikawa added: “Kano Pillars did not enter into any monetary agreement with Musa. There is no sign-on fee or salary placed on him. Based on the experience and exposure of Musa with various big clubs overseas, Pillars can’t afford his wages at this point.” “The Eagles captain is not playing for money. His target is to help Kano Pillars, the club where he started his footballing career before moving overseas, to finish on a successful note in the NPFL and also help create more awareness in the NPFL. “On our part, the management of Kano Pillars has finished the administrative aspect of Musa’s contract. Musa would be joining the team on Monday. “The remaining decision on how he will be traveling with the team for league matches, the games he will play and the first game he will be playing will be determined by Pillars coaches. “I believe when Ahmed Musa meets with Pillars players and coaches, they will decide if he would be given the captain’s position on not. It is a technical issue, not administrative.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
