The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned the wanton attacks on police personnel and formations in Abia, Imo, Ebonyi and Anambra states as well as Rivers State The APC, in a statement by its Caretaker Secretary, Dr. James Akpanudoedehe, described the development, which culminated in Saturday’s brazen and gruesome attack on the residence of Governor Hope Uzodimma, as unacceptable. The party urged security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of the attacks and their sponsors and be made to face the full weight of the law to restore dignity to the citizenry and confidence in the system, particularly democratic and security structures. “The party and indeed our security services will definitely not watch helplessly as some persons and interests attempt to turn Imo State into a killing field. We call on the good people of Imo State to go about their legal activities without fear and resist these enemies of the state. “We stand with the Nigeria Police Force and families of the victims in this difficult time as we mourn the death of innocent and dedicated security personnel simply carrying out their duty of protecting life and property. “In Imo State, the attack on the governor’s residence is an attack on democracy and constituted authority serving the interest of the good people of Imo State. “While we are still in shock over the ugly turn of events in the state, the party sympathises with Hope Uzodimma and all affected in the bestial attack. We have since learnt that there were fatalities with others injured and maimed during the attack.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
