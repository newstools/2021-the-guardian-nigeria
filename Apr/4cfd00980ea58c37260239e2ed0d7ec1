The full-back joins fellow Italian Marco Verratti who has also tested positive. For the first leg of their quarterfinal in Munich on Wednesday, PSG was already without Argentine Leandro Paredes, who is suspended, as well as midfielder Verratti. Florenzi and Verratti were both parts of the Italian squad on the recent international break. The tie is a rematch of last season’s final, in which Bayern won 1-0. Florenzi “will therefore respect the isolation and is subject to the appropriate health protocol”, said PSG saying that “the player has been in isolation for several days as a precaution”. The full-back, on loan from Roma, was not on the team sheet for Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to Lille in Ligue 1. In his absence, coach Mauricio Pochettino’s options at right-back include German Thilo Kehrer and Frenchman Colin Dagba.
