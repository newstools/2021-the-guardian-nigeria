To alleviate the suffering of the masses, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Mercyland Parish, Lagos Province 44, has donated bags of rice, salt and other food items to 1000 families. In a presentation service at Odunlami Street, Lagos Island, the special guest of honour and Chairman, Lagos Island East Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Kamal Olawale Salau Bashua, represented by John Akinsuyi, commended the church for truly acting as a good neighbour, as stated in the Bible. The Province Pastor, Amos Emovon, charged congregants to receive Jesus as their source of energy, strength and everything that money cannot buy. The Assistant Pastor-in-Charge of the Province, Christian Social Responsibility (CSR), Pastor Ajibola Opeoluwa-Calebs, said RCCG was passionately committed to fighting hunger and poverty within its communities. He added that the gesture was in alignment with the church’s vision and mission, as a way of positively impacting the quality of lives within communities, where its parishes are located. The Parish CSR Committee’s Chairperson, Mrs. Titi Osuntoki, said Feeding A Thousand Families Programme started last year and reminded worshippers of the various CSR initiatives, including Back-to-School programmes; donation of neonatal equipment to Massey Street Children’s Hospital, Lagos; provision of glasses and surgery for the elderly around Lagos Island; boreholes to several communities; monthly feeding within the communities and various medical/health awareness interventions.
