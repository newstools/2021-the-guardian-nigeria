The seventh edition of iDESIGN Affordable Art Fair ends today in Lagos. The show, which held at Nimbus Art Centre, Ikoyi, Lagos, started on March 26, 2021. Unlike the previous editions, which often held for three days, this edition ran for an extended period of 16 days, providing opportunity for art lovers and enthusiasts to visit the fair. Since 2018, the show has been building an audience from all walks of life, paying particular attention to those who are new to the scene. According to the management, the ultimate goal is to grow a community of people who appreciate Nigerian contemporary art. The fair’s curator, Arinola Olowoporoku, said, “we were forced into moments of reflection and introspection, further evidenced by the work curated in the fair. The context for presenting these works just got bigger as artists are exploring a myriad of distinct visual themes to unravel the fast paced global occurrences.” Founded by Tola Akerele, an avid culture and art enthusiast, who is passionate about making these important facets of culture accessible to all, this edition featured original digitalised art. “I am particularly excited to announce the launch of iDESIGN Prints, works that are mainly produced through new media and technology. Art continues to be integral to the iDESIGN philosophy in the interior design styling process of transforming homes and spaces, be it through art or digital prints,” said Olowoporoku. Works from over 20 artists are on show including those of Debayo Atanda, Chigozie Obi and Gerald Chukwuma. An online purchasing portal was also created for those unable to attend physically and for African art enthusiasts across the globe.
