 House of Representatives  The Chairman of the committee, Rep. Unyime Idem (PDP-Akwa Ibom) gave the assurance on Friday while addressing newsmen at the National Assembly complex in Abuja. Idem said that a bill to compel service providers to implement pay-per-view has passed second reading in the house. He said that the bill, when passed into law, would expand the powers of the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to ensure the implementation of pay-per-view tariff. Idem, who represents Ukanafun/Orukanam Federal Constituency of Akwa-Ibom, said that the process to implement pay-per-view tariff started in June 2020 and would not be swept under the carpet. “I want to assure Nigerians that after the passage of the bill, the issue of indiscriminate price increase even when Nigerians do not expect and service not consumed will be a thing of the past. “I want to appeal to Nigerians to be patient and hopeful as the bill will soon come up for third reading,” he said. Idem, also the Deputy Chairman, House Committee on Communication, assured that the bill would break the monopoly currently witnessed in the sector. According to him, it will open up the space for more local and foreign operators to come in and there will be more options for Nigerians. The lawmaker said that it would create a lot of employment opportunities, noting that the number of companies coming in will help grow the economy.
