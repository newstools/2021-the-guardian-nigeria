Budding RnB singer/songwriter, Blezed is a well-versed artiste in all aspects of contemporary Nigeria’s music. Unlike many who became musicians accidentally, Blezed began his journey in a submissive, respectful and humble way. “I remember a certain young man while growing up who came from his village to Lagos in search of a better life. At the moment, he is a recognised figure in society and has done so well for himself. This inspires me to know that I can achieve anything I put my mind to achieve regardless of any disadvantage,” he said, while recounting a real-life situation that inspired him. This, he revealed, is part of what inspires his music composition. “Life, love, and people inspire my music. My songs communicate not only my artistic expression but also elements of my story and life experiences, offering a unique perspective into my world and hopefully helping people flow through their daily lives. I want my music to help people connect with their deepest emotions and, thus, live a more colourful and interesting life,” he said. Many were shocked recently when the award-winning singer, Praiz gave songwriting credit to the youngster for his classic tune, Under The Sky. The song won the Best Vocal Performance (Male) at the just-concluded 14th Headies Award. “Under the Sky is a baring of the soul and an emotional story that leaves you with your heart full of love and hope,” Praiz said, as he lauded the writer. Being the industry where songwriters are not getting enough recognition for their crafts, Blezed has been working behind the scenes to write hit songs for many A-list artistes in the Nigerian music space. A graduate of accountancy from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, he has written several hit songs for popular names in the industry that he resolved to disclose. A dynamic artiste whose ambition is to become a world-class songwriter like Paul McCartney, he spoke how he met Praiz through his mentor, Timi Dakolo. “Timi Dakolo is a great mentor I met through a friend (Beekay) who introduced me to him. Timi usually gave me books to read and from time to time, would correct my songs,” he hinted. “After I released a certain song title Ekum, Praiz heard it and contacted me to write a song like mine. That’s how I wrote Under the sky and that song won an award for Best Vocal Performance at the just concluded Headies awards,” he noted. He continued: “I have also collaborated with Timi Dakolo in writing a couple of his songs in recent times and it has been a great privilege developing my skill as a songwriter.” He disclosed that he gets motivated when people especially superstars lauded his work, saying, “One time, Praiz was asked to mention his three Favourite growing artistes in the music industry, and he mentioned me; that was super encouraging!” Indeed, Blezed’s songwriting abilities have been touted since he released Ekum (My Love) in 2019. He flex his musical muscle when he dropped Make Me feel on February 10, last year. To further prove his writing dexterity, Blezed is currently working on his Extended Play (EP) titled Better Days, which would be out soon. Born Blessed Uzodima Eke, but popularly known by his moniker Blezed, the Abia State born singer was raised in Lagos. The versatile artiste, who started his songwriting/singing at a tender age becomes fans’ favourite when featured at a reality TV shows, Project Fame and The Voice respectively.
