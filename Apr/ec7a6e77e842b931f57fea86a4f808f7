The Boko Haram terrorists in gun trucks attacked Geidam, Friday, forcing residents to flee for safety, as they broke their Ramadan fast in Yobe. The insurgents in 10 gun trucks torched the telecom masts of Airtel and MTN, cutting off people from communicating on the attack of the border town with Niger. Confirming the incident, yesterday, in Damaturu, the Police Command Spokesman, Dungus Abdulkarim said: “Leaflets written in Arabic and Hausa were distributed to residents of Geidam Thursday before the terrorists struck during the breaking of fast. “The insurgents were advocating for the establishment of a Caliphate in Geidam Township. The border town was attacked severally this year and 2019, with the torching of military and police posts in the last five years. “The terrorists first struck on Friday evening, but they took cover following airstrikes from the military.”
 Bukar Modu, a resident, said it was after the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jet hovered around the town before the terrorists returned to the community by 8 pm. “They wreaked havoc on the town this morning (Saturday). They torched buildings before looting food items from shops and warehouses in Geidam. We are more frightened this time around because we don’t know their mission…” he said. Also, the military claimed yesterday that the terrorists were repelled. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
