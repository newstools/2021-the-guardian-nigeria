 Governor Oyetola of Osun. Photo: TWITTER/GBOYEGAOYETOLA  The known copious coping mechanisms must be resuscitated. We need to reinvent the spirit of communal living as in the days of old. Essentially, if those who are wealthy in the society will shun vainglory and noise-making about their wealth, and embrace genuine philanthropy with the fear of God, it will go a long way in turning around the society. Otherwise, even, the so-called wealth will become a sneer to the rich, in a society of hungry and angry people.
 
‘Olowo kan laarin otosi mefa’ (One rich man among six paupers)! Somebody, who left school eleven years ago but does not have a job up till now; what do you want him to do in a non-supportive society?  
Komolafe is senior special assistant to Governor Oyetola on Media. So, irrespective of denomination, our religious leaders need to teach doctrines as in the days of old, when life was peaceful and safer.
 
In summary, one can safely say that, what this government is doing is beyond a mere response to the negative impacts of COVID-19. It is the need of our time! In other words, initiatives such as Osun food support scheme ought to have started long before COVID-19 in all the states of the federation.  
 
May the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, make Gboyega Oyetola’s Administration the best in the history of the State of Osun!
