Disturbed by the outcome of global research revealing that fewer persons brush twice daily, experts have launched #BrushWithMe campaign to sensitise Nigerians on importance of improved hygiene in this COVID-19 era. During the pandemic-compliant conference graced by professionals, including parent influencers, Mrs. Mercy Johnson Okojie and Sisi Yemmie; dentists, Dr. Timi Akinmuda, Dr. Uyi Idah, Dr. Feyisike Dauda (representatives of the Nigerian Dental Association) and Director of Dentistry, Federal Ministry of Health, Dr. Bola Alonge, in Lagos, the gathering regretted that oral health was not prioritised during the lockdown. The dentists, among the participants, confirmed that less people visited dental clinics despite the fact that more confirmed cases had been reported in the last one year. Dr. Precious Ofili, who joined virtually, noted that oral health diseases were largely caused by poor hygiene, admitting that some have their causes in intrinsic issues within the body system. According to Alonge, brushing at night is a good preventive measure against oral health ailments, such as cavities and tooth decay, as it helps to prevent the overnight infestation of the tooth by micro organisms, which in turn leads to holes in the teeth and decay. The experts stated that tooth decay was world’s most widespread disease and dental cavities one of the most prevalent conditions among children globally. In his contribution transmitted virtually, founder of Slum2School Africa, Otto Orondaam, lauded the organisers for the people-centric projects over the years. Also, the Category Manager for Oral Care, Toluwaleke Salu, pledged Pepsodent’s continued adherence to industry standards and consumer health. She added that her firm had in over five years been educating millions of school children on imperativeness of brushing day and night, as well as equipping them with needed products. While the central theme – nudging parents to pay more attention to their oral health, as children mimic their everyday’s daily habits – was not lost on the families, the event also touched on diets and practices that could improve oral hygiene for households and individuals. The study had shown a five per cent drop in adults and an 11 per cent dip in children compared to the two years before outbreak of the virus. Parents had equally admitted to being more relaxed with their kids’ oral health habits during the pandemic. Three in five (61 per cent) parents let their children eat sugary foods before bed.  The research also showed that parents’ poor oral habits have an impact on children. This impact was accurately captured in the findings that indicated that children are seven times more likely to skip tooth brushing if their parents do not brush day and night.
