Martell In perfect weather, on a beautifully sunny Easter Saturday, Beach is Better Group x Martell Nigeria hosted a special Oasis Experience in Lagos, Nigeria. Famous for hosting well-known celebrities, influencers and prestigious guests, stylish invitees were treated to a tranquil atmosphere, complete with a delightful,
flavoursome spread provided by Z Kitchen and an uninterrupted supply of crisp, sharp and delicious Martellinfused cocktails. Apt for this time of year, we gather the dress code in their well-curated invitation packs was creamy, silk and
linen; ideal for an afternoon of socially distanced mingling with guests, while sashaying to the sounds of B.I.B
Resident DJ Obi.
