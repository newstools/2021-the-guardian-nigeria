Following the rising yields in the money market instruments, the bears maintained dominance on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).

Analysts link the lull in the equities market to macroeconomic challenges bedeviling the nation’s economy. For instance, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion said: ” It is obvious that the nation’s stagflation is not driven by excess liquidity in the system but the cost pushed, arising from policy mismatch which is fueling insecurity, unemployment, and high cost of living. “If these are not checked by policymakers and economic managers, it could short-live the fragile economic recovery recorded so far. There is a need for the government to carry out structural reforms that will boost recovery and growth at the desired pace for the benefit of all Nigerians. “However, monetary policy alone cannot do much to revamp the economy, without the fiscal side complementing the monetary policy actions. In the end, the high rate of borrowing from the public will translate to a high cost of financing the 2021 budget.” Analysts at Codros Capital said: “With the Q1, 2021 earnings season on the horizon, we believe investors will be looking for how corporate earnings will evolve in 2021, given the expected improvement in macroeconomic conditions. “However, we expect the lull in the market to persist as investors remain perturbed by the rising yields in the FI market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” A review of market performance last week indicated that renewed profit-taking embarked by investors, the NGX halted gaining streak to reopen on a downward note on Monday, causing the All-Share Index (ASI) to decline by 0.4 per cent.
