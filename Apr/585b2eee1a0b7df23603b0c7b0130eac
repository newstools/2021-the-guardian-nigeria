MTN Nigeria has said that it is currently engaging the banking community to align on a longer-term pricing structure for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) platform.
   
MTN said this yesterday while assuring its subscribers of improved services on the platform.Recall that the banks had blocked MTN customers last Friday, leaving millions of MTN subscribers frustrated as they were unable to recharge airtime and perform other digital transactions via USSD at the weekend into the Easter celebrations. The crises brewed from the fact that the banks had cited gradual profit cuts from 5.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The banks owed the telecommunications operators N42 billion in yet-to-be remitted USSD debts.
   
But with the intervention of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, a temporary settlement was reached, which led to the unblocking of the USSD channels.
