At that point, Orense players and management complained to referee Roberto Sanchez, who ended up giving the goalkeeper a straight red card,” online newspaper Primicias reported. Television footage captured only the moment of the Argentine’s dismissal in second-half stoppage time. “The goalkeeper was sent off for unsporting behaviour,” newspaper El Comercio reported in its online edition. Midfielder Segundo Portocarrero, who had scored his team’s winner, took over in goal for the dying seconds of the match. Pucheta faces a suspension of three to six months under Ecuadorian league rules.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
