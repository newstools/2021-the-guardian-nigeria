A man who may have been an accomplice in November’s deadly jihadist gun attack in the Austrian capital Vienna has been arrested, prosecutors said on Saturday. Convicted Islamic State sympathiser Kujtim Fejzulai killed four people on the evening of November 2 before being shot dead by police in the first major attack in Austria for decades and the first blamed on a jihadist. A spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutors’ department told AFP the arrested man was being investigated over a possible “contribution” to the attack. Investigators were still looking into whether he was an active accomplice or simply knew of Fejzulai’s plans, the spokeswoman said. According to media reports, the  21-year-old Austrian national of Egyptian heritage was arrested on Friday at his parents’ flat in one of Vienna’s southern suburbs. The attack was followed by a wave of arrests of people believed to be linked to Fejzulai, some of whom were subsequently released. Prosecutors say that around 10 suspects are still in custody but that as yet no charges have been pressed.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
