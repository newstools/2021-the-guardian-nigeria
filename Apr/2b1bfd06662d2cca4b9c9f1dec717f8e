 [FILES] Enyimba  It is crunch time for Nigeria’s remaining club in the continent, Enyimba of Aba. The People’s Elephant will host South Africa’s Orlando Pirates in their last group stage match of the CAF Confederation Cup, a game they must win to remain in the competition. The two-time African champions are without suspended captain and leading scorer, Augustine Oladapo, but in Victor Mbaoma and Anayo Iwuala, they have enough in their armoury to down the unbeaten Buccaneers to gain a quarterfinals berth. Enyimba Coach, Fatai Osho, yesterday agreed that his team faced a daunting task against Orlando Pirates, adding, “I knew this group would go down to the wire. We must collect maximum points against Pirates to keep alive our hopes of becoming the first winners from Nigeria.” When the teams met in South Africa, the Buccaneers won 2-1, but today they are faced with an Enyimba side that has won all their last four home games in the competition. The match will kick off by 10.00 p.m., which means Enyimba fans will not have the opportunity of watching it live at the stadium. There is an 8.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. curfew in Abia State, which means fans need a special pass to go to the stadium. All four clubs in Group A, including Entente Setif of Algeria, who will host Al Ahly Benghazi of Libya in the other Group A fixture, can still qualify for the next round.
