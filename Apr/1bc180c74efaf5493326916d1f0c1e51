The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has urged the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) to reconsider its planned nationwide strike scheduled to commence today. The NBA said that as commendable and laudable as the proposed strike might be, it was concerned about its timing and the potentially-devastating consequences it would pose for justice administration in the country, particularly coming on the heels of prolonged lull in judicial activities owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the enforced lockdown. In a statement, yesterday, signed by its President, Olumide Akpata, the body said that as the courts were trying to catch up for lost time, it would be catastrophic for the administration of justice to shut down the courts again. “This is not to mention the adverse economic consequences for families and lawyers alike, who earn a living in one way or the other, by providing various support services to the court system. “For the avoidance of doubt, the NBA, as a leading stakeholder in the justice sector, and in keeping with its motto of promoting the rule of law, is in support of the demands of JUSUN, and has been a constant voice of advocacy towards enthroning judicial autonomy,” the group said. MEANWHILE, the House of Representatives has waded into the plan by JUSUN to embark on the strike. Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Mr. Onofiok Luke, urged the union to stand down on its proposed strike pending the outcome of the House engagement with the governments both at the federal and state levels towards resolving the outstanding issues. The committee, in a statement, said that while the cause of the union is desirable, it might at the moment expose litigants to untold hardship and limit their access to justice.
