The battle over the appropriate structure of the state is by no means over. The other day, in fiscal garb, it surfaced on the floor of the Nigerian upper legislative chamber, the Senate. The scuffle is over the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), now the preference of countries who believe in saving for the rainy day. The smart move is an initiative from Senator Bassey Albert Akpan, representing the people’s Democratic Party, Akwa Ibom State. The senator is seeking an amendment to Section 162 of the constitution to make the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) get 20 per cent of revenues accruing to the Federation Account monthly. In other words, amend the relevant provisions of the constitution to make the SWF a first-line charge beneficiary of the Federation.
 
It is to be noted that the SWF is a state-owned investment fund from money generated by the government. According to financial experts, the money could come from the country’s surplus reserves and other sources of revenues such as natural resources, trade surpluses, bank reserves from budgeting excesses, foreign currency operations, money from privatisation and government transfer payments among others. Its benefits for the citizens and country are immeasurable.   To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
