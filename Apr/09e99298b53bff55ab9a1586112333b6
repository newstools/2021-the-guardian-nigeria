The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) gathered that the victims were released on Tuesday after payment of an undisclosed amount as ransom. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Adewale Osifeso, confirmed the release of the abductees. “Yes, they have been released,” he said. Osifeso did not, however, disclosed whether ransom was paid before the release of the victim. It would be recalled that the kidnappers visited the hotel in Ogbomoso at about 10 p.m. on Saturday pretending to be lodgers and shot sporadically into the air before kidnapping the victims. The kidnappers had demanded N32 million ransom for the release of the abductees. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
