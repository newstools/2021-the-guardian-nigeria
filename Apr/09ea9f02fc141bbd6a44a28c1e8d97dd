Former MMA Star Ronda Rousey Announces She Is Expecting Her First Child Ronda Rousey, who followed Olympic judo bronze with a stellar mixed martial arts career, is expecting her first child with husband Travis Browne. Rousey revealed in a YouTube video on Wednesday that she’s four months pregnant. In the video, with a laugh ad Browne gave her a kiss and a hug, she said: I can’t hide it anymore, so it’s time to show it off. The video, which is very sweet, features several clips of Rousey and Browne from the past four months. They’re shown just moments after they learned the pregnancy test was positive, and we get to see Baby Rousey-Browne in ultrasounds and sonograms. In the video, 34-year-old Rousey said that there’s more to their pregnancy story than what was shown, but she and Browne are planning to share it at a later date. It was part of a video that clips of the 34-year-old attending doctor appointments with Browne. Rousey won judo bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before becoming the Ultimate Fighting Championship women’s bantamweight champion. She won 13 straight bouts and helped establish UFC as a global brand before fellow American Holly Holm knocked her out in 2015. Rousey has also tried her hand at WWE wrestling and appeared in action movies, including “Expendables 3” and “Furious 7”. Rousey, a UFC Hall of Famer, has spent the last several years focusing on a wrestling career with the WWE. She won her first championship in 2018 and held it for a then-record 231 days. Her championship reign ended at WrestleMania 35, where she faced Becky Lynch and lost her first-ever match. After WrestleMania 35, Rousey took a planned hiatus. She and Browne, also a former UFC fighter, had married in 2017 and wanted to start a family, which she made clear on Instagram back in 2019. Rousey and Browne didn’t reveal the gender of the baby just yet but said they’ll be doing a gender reveal soon.
