The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Commissioner of Police Bala Ciroma has advised its officers and men not to abandon the use of face masks, hand sanitisers, and other COVID-19 protocols. Ciroma made the call when the AA Zaura Foundation, donated cartons of hand sanitisers and face masks to the FCT command. He said that it was important for its officers to adhere to the protocols and not relent in observing it, as they were front-line workers adding that due to the nature of their responsibilities, it was necessary for them to take preventive measures against contracting virus. “We appreciate the donation of the face masks and sanitisers by the AA Zaura Foundation, it will go a long way in protecting our personnel from being infected. “You will realise that our work is such that you do not know the state of health of the person you are working with as the police station is a public place where everybody comes in to. “And you have to entertain people, you cannot start asking them of their health status as at that time and they might come in distress. “So if we have some preventing measures like the face masks and the sanitisers, it will assist in protecting our personnel,” he added. While donating the items, Abdulsalam Abdulkarim, Founder, AA Zaura Foundation, said the gesture was part of the organisation’s corporate social responsibility geared towards securing the police personnel from the scourge of Coronavirus. “The police associate themselves with different types of people, so they can not know who has the virus and who does not have it. “So the foundation felt the police should be the first to be protected because they face and receive a lot of people all the time,” he said. He added that the foundation would continue to support the Nigerian Police Force and other paramilitary organisations in the country.
