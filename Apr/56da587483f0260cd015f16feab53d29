Says criminal informants abound in North West Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has decried the activities of Nigerians sabotaging the war against terrorism, banditry and other forms of criminalities. Speaking to reporters at the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, Shehu recalled how a tea vendor in the North West zone tipped off bandits to escape bombardment of their hideout. Lamenting the security challenges in the country, he solicited the support of Nigerians to nip the country’s security challenges in the bud.
Assuring that security operatives are on top of their game, he said kidnapping and banditry predated the Buhari-led administration. He said: “We also have bad eggs in our own communities, who reveal the secrets of our military. There is this man that sold tea near the Katsina airport. The sponsors of bandits hired him, built a house for him, bought him a golf car and gave him money to do bigger tea business. “Each time a military aircraft took off from Katsina for Zamfara, he would call the bandits on phone. So, before the soldiers got there, the target would have disappeared. So there are bad people in our communities. What are we doing as citizens to rid ourselves of informants because the military are human with blood running in their veins.” He lamented daily media reports of killings, describing the situation as tragic. “It is tragic. Nobody is happy that deaths are being recorded. But the point I want to make is that, it is in the human nature; we don’t know any country in the world today that is crime-free. “So we have problems with infiltration of unauthorised weapons; hence President Buhari ordered that anyone caught with AK-47, except law enforcement agents, should be shot immediately,” he added.
