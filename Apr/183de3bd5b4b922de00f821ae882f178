Networks should be segmented and components hardened. Disaster recovery, business continuity, and data recovery plans should be in place and tested periodically.
 
6. New forms of 5G vulnerabilities will emerge 5G technology will be one of the greatest drivers and revolutions of this decade, enabling the fastest and broadest connectivity for humanity. As the 5G technology adoption set in as the standard form of cloud-based data transfer and communication, more vulnerabilities, compromises, and new cybersecurity threats will also emerge. In 2021, the 5G broadband will provide cybercriminals and hackers with the capability to inject data packets across networks using high-speed data transfers and conduct corporate espionage with limited interference without these companies knowing. Organisations will need to prepare specially for the 5G technology adoption and provide higher security scrutiny and monitoring levels. Training and awareness will be supreme in this crusade to provide the capacity and know-how within the organisation.
 
7. The number of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) groups will continue to grow There have been increased hackers and cybercriminals’ activities across the clear, deep, and dark web using Advanced Persistence Threat (APT), with new groups emerging every day. The dark web, for instance, allows cybercriminals and hackers to have access to sensitive information and corporate networks, transact on stolen credit 4 cards, etc. More actors are joining the foray, and these groups are continuously growing across different sectors and interests.  9. Organisations will pay more attention to Cybersecurity.
 With the expansion of remote working and increased digital transformation adoption triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, executive management has seen the reality of cyber risks and the implications to business continuity. This has elevated cybersecurity conversation to a board room agenda, and most organisations are giving adequate consideration to information security as a strategic component of the business strategy.
  
In 2021, many organisations will be very deliberate in managing cybersecurity, including appointing the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) as a C-suite within the executive management. 10. Cybersecurity Automation will increase Cybercriminals have devised several ways of stealing and accessing corporate databases and networks, and these techniques are being improved daily. Cybersecurity automation simplifies organisations’ response in providing a faster response and efficient containment mechanism. With the growth in the number of cyber-attacks and the increasing accuracy of cybercriminals in gaining access to systems, cybersecurity automation is a safe solution to prevent cyber-attacks and data breaches.
  
In 2021, the focus of cybersecurity automation will include automation of threat correlation, automated enforcement of MFA on ANY resource, authentication 5 sequence, vulnerability scanning, Penetration Tests, security patch management, traffic logs, etc. Conclusion In 2021, organisations will scramble to deal with the far-reaching effects while striving to stay secure as online dependency grows.
 
These suggestions and recommendations are not only plausible but should also be anticipated. We looked into the drivers of cybersecurity’s near future and how organisations will have to adapt as threats and technologies exert their influence. It is pertinent that organisations and decision-makers frame a proper and strategic response that can withstand change and disruption. Organisations need to be proactive in managing cybersecurity initiatives, including beefing up cybersecurity programs, implementing cybersecurity systems, managing vulnerabilities and risks, testing incidence response and business continuity plans.
