A Japanese man has been arrested after scamming 35 women with whom he was in a relationship at the same time. Takashi Miyagawa, a 39-year-old part-time worker with no fixed abode from the Japanese region of Kansai, had told each of the women, who were completely oblivious to each other’s existence, that his birthday was on a different date thereby receiving gifts and cards from all of them. Miyagwa’s real birthday is November 13.

A third woman, who is 35, said she believed it was in April. According to SoraNews24, the total number of victims stands at 35 with the possibility of more coming forwards.
