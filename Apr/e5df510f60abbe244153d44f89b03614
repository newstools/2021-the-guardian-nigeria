Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor, yesterday declared that Nigeria forbids illegal bearing of arms and anyone found with such weapons is an enemy of the state. Addressing Journalists in Asaba, Delta State, after meeting with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, Irabor stated that “The mandate of the President for dealing with anyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms. The armed forces and other security agencies are the only ones mandated to carry arms, so anyone carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon is a threat to the existence of the state. Because he is an enemy of the state, it must be addressed.” He said that he was in Delta for the first time since he was appointed CDS and commended Governor Okowa for his support to the armed forces and other security agencies in the state. Congratulating Irabor on his appointment and promotion, Okowa urged him to do more to secure the nation.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
