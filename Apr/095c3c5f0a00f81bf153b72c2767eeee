DSS The Department of State Services (DSS) has said that the late official driver to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Saâ€™idu Afaka, was not detained or tortured by the service before his death. A statement by Dr Peter Afunanya,  DSS  Public Relations Officer on Thursday in Abuja, said that reports in some section of the media that the department tortured the late driver to death was misleading information. Afunanya said the driver was never arrested nor detained by the department. According to him, the suspect handling method is usually in compliance with the tenets of the criminal justice administration system and democracy. The DSS spokesman, therefore, urged the public to disregard the fake news trending on the online platform. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, on April 6 announced the death of Afaka. Shehu said the late driver died after a prolonged illness and extended the condolences of the President to his family.
