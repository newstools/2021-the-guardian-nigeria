The all-share index (ASI) appreciated by 0.01 per cent. At the close of transactions yesterday, the ASI grew by 3.46 absolute points, representing a growth of 0.01 per cent to close at 39,131.8 points. Market capitalisation also gained by N1 billion to close at N20.479 trillion. The upward trend was sustained, following buy-interest in the oil and gas sector. The sectorial index advanced 0.2 per cent following the price uptick in Oando Plc. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage said: “Following four consecutive sessions of positive closes in the market, expect the week to end on a mixed note, as some investors take profits on earlier gains in the banking sector.” The market gain was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; PZ Cussons Nigeria, United Bank for Africa (UBA), UAC of Nigeria, Cutix and Oando. Consequently, the market breadth closed positive, as 17 stocks appreciated while 15 constituted the losers’ chart. Cutix recorded the highest price gain of seven per cent to close at N2.14 kobo.
