How to Sell without Selling. Most businesses migrate online with the same mindset they had offline, the mindset of making sales. While this is good, businesses must understand that promoting a business online comes with a different strategy; relationship building is key. People come to interact and build relationships online and not to buy; that is why it is called social media. Every business owner must therefore key into this to make money online. They should focus on interactions and building relationships through creating valuable, relatable and consistent content around their business and around themselves. These contents should focus around solving the problem of their target audience as regards to their brand/business. When this is done, it makes the target audience trust the business owner enough to do business with him/her and this is where they make the most sales.

– Understand that clarity is a journey. You will never have it all figured at once. The further you go, the clearer it becomes.
– Have the mind to ‘serve’ and not to make money. Doing the first guarantees the second.
– Never take relationships for granted. Build profitable relationships with people below you, within you and above you.
– Never stop investing in yourself. The market out there is a very dynamic one. If you stop growing, you get left behind. What I Would Change If I Were To Be The President Of Nigeria

Just start! Start anything; it doesn’t mean you always have to continue with it. Stop over thinking, most of these thoughts are just in your head and may not happen. Expose yourself to new ideas, relationships and places. Be selfless when building relationships especially with people you admire. Serve them with your skills and knowledge and don’t always think of what they can give you. Whatever journey you embark on won’t be easy, so prepare to be disappointed, confused, discouraged etc. But no matter what happens, keep pushing. Keep tweaking until you see what works, take a break if you must but make sure you come back stronger.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
