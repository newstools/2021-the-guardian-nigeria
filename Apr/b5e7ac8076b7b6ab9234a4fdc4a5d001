 Foreign exchange  xemptions of items permitted at its FX windows also affect price discovery as end users are pushed to other segments. Hence, the parallel market was the only segment supporting price discovery, although this too is imperfect given the tendency for speculative activities driven by the CBN’s approach.  The obsession with a fixed rate affects a timely adjustment to a new equilibrium price, given that this is even unclear, as information is changing rapidly. Instead, the CBN should intervene through volume and transact at market price. This should be timely, for a limited time, until it supports orderly adjustment to a new equilibrium. The CBN must seek to bring more players into the market rather than alienate them as it has frequently done. While FX liquidity challenges affect markets, this could be temporary if policymakers allow for price discovery, which is the adjustment of rates to a new equilibrium that is determined by and is satisfactory to buyers and sellers. The CBN derives its powers from controlling the majority of FX receipts in the economy even though it does not earn them. If the market is liberalised such that earners of FX – businesses, FG, and states – are free to sell in whatever segment they can receive the best value, liquidity and price discovery would improve substantially.
