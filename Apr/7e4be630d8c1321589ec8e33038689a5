Emmanuel commended his Delta counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa for his commitment to the development of the state in spite the scarce resources and inflation in the country. “Once you see a governor trying to sign his signature in a community, it means he really likes that community. So many areas are crying for development with the little resources we have and the rate of inflammation that we are also going through. I thank the governor for signing his signature in this community,” he said.

Governor Emmanuel acknowledged that the South-South states where PDP states and would remain PDP, just as he added that all the development going on in the country were only in place states governed by PDP. The governor explained that the real dividend of democracy was the projects that were put on ground for the use of the common man.
