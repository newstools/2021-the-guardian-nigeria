 House of Representatives  The Ekiti federal lawmaker, who stated this against the backdrop of the strike embarked upon by the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) and Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) that have grounded the two arms of government, urged the governors to treat independence of judiciary and legislature as a matter of urgent importance. Specifically, Ogunlola advised the governors to work according to the principle of separation of powers with the judiciary and legislature to develop the country’s democracy. The All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker, who is representing Ekiti West/ Efon/ Ijero Federal Constituency, spoke in Ijero Ekiti, at the weekend. Lamenting the total closure of the judicial and legislative arms across the nation, Ogunlola said: “The constitution is very explicit that there are three arms of government, though interrelated, with classified and established functions to the extent that there shouldn’t be an encroachment. “But it is regrettable that anything goes in Nigeria, because of our penchant for illegalities. When it comes to issues of proper applications of the laws, custodians of the laws will distance themselves or keep silent. The unfortunate thing now is that our laws are no longer respected. “ The National Assembly is preparing for a review of our laws and we are going to review this and spell out the functions of all the arms to show how governance should be.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
