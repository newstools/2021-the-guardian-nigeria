The Episcopal Vicar of Lagos Region, Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos and Parish Priest, St. Anthony Catholic, Gbaja, Surulere, Very Rev. Msgr. Bernard Ayodele Okodua has called on the government to initiate welfare projects that will cater for citizens, saying this will reduce restiveness and criminalities among the youth, adding that justice, equity and fairness will reduce clamour for disintegration. Okodua stated this during the announcement of the 60-day Diamond anniversary celebration of the parish, which according, to him, will focus majorly on the Church’s unrelenting commitment and continuous response to the needs and growth of the immediate community. The cleric, who tasked political leaders to promote unity as well as equal developmental projects and appointments, said that as part of the celebration, the church will carry out medical checks and treatment and also give out monetary palliatives, among others, to the elderly in Gbaja Community in Surulere, irrespective of faith and age, while specific talk will be targeted at women, youth and children. “Nobody wants a break up of Nigeria and we can only avoid this by doing the right thing. When there is no justice, there cannot be peace and when there is no justice, there will be chaos. To drive this point home, the church has decided to celebrate our Diamond anniversary have decided to put smiles on the faces of the elderly, women, youth, and the children in our community,”  Okodua said. The President, Laity Council of the parish, Mr. Philip Odiachi, said the church had in the past built some blocks of classrooms and cafeteria for Gbaja Girls’ Junior and Senior Secondary Schools, provided healthcare delivery to the public, as well as carried out youth empowerment programmes in the community.
