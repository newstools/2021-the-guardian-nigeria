 globacom  The company made the call in a congratulatory message to Christians on the successful completion of the Lenten season. Globacom, in a statement in Lagos, urged Christians to use the Easter period to reflect deeply on the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made on the Cross and engage in acts of sacrifice, peace and love for one another during this season and beyond. “It will, therefore, not be in the true spirit of Christianity if we do not exhibit sacrifice, love, and peace as espoused by Christ, the reason for the celebration,” Globacom said. It added that the current challenges being experienced in the country are an indication of lack of love, selflessness, and oneness. “To the followers of Christ, the true message of Easter proclaims the greatest act of love known to man. God’s infinite love for mankind is symbolised by the sacrifice of his only son for the benefit of the human race, a love that will continue into eternity,” the company added. The statement noted that the traditional purpose of Lent is a season of reflection and preparation before the celebration of Easter.
