• Gunmen abduct three women in Ibadan
• Doctors, nurses declare strike over insecurity in Ogun
• Residents flee, schools shutdown as gunmen kill six in Rivers As security agencies continue to grapple with upsurge in kidnapping and banditry, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said that the country’s victory in its battle against insecurity is around the corner. Pastor Adeboye made this known yesterday when he paid a courtesy call on Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, at Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, days after some RCCG members were abducted in the state. The respected cleric had announced his visit to Kaduna on his Twitter handle, when he wrote:
“Earlier today, I decided to go out of my schedule to see my children who God delivered from the den of kidnappers while they were on their way to the venue of the Lets Go Fishing exercise. To the Glory of God, they are hale and hearty.” Adeboye disclosed that Governor El-Rufai “appealed to me to visit the State House in Kaduna to pray for the state, its people and its leadership for peace and protection after laying hands on my children who were sick. It is my prayer that the peace and kingdom of God will be established in Kaduna State.” Adeboye had on April 8 announced that eight of his church members kidnapped by bandits on March 26 in Kaduna had regained freedom. Shortly after their release, all the abducted persons were taken to a hospital for medical check-up. The clergyman, who said he has known the governor for many years, described El-Rufai as a tender-hearted man and that many who might be criticizing him now will later see the other side of him. “We know that you have a problem that only God can solve. The problem is far beyond the abilities of any human being. We have known each other for years. I know the kind of person you are. I know you are tender-hearted, I know how you definitely must be feeling, particularly when the kidnappings are going on. When they begin to kidnap school children, I know how you must be feeling.” The General Overseer assured the governor that “victory is around the corner. We are praying for you and I believe God is going to answer the prayers. I am assuring you that the Almighty God is going to fight for you, He is going to fight for Kaduna State, He is going to fight for Nigeria.’’ In his response, Governor El-Rufai commiserated with the RCCG family over the recent abduction of some pastors and parishioners in Kaduna, adding that “we seek your blessings and prayers, as a great man of God, to assist us with the challenges that we are facing here and the country at large.” DESPITE the assurances of a turn in the bend by Pastor Adeboye, the kidnap epidemic continued without restrain across the country. A police officer was shot while trying to foil the abduction of some members of Tungan-Maje community in Gwagwalada Area Council of Abuja yesterday. Witnesses said the gallant officer, Inspector Ambi John, who was leading one of the teams in repelling the attack, sustained gunshot injuries and was rushed to hospital for medical attention but passed away eventually. The kidnappers were operating along Dankusa, Angwan-Zegele-Zuba axis when a distress call was sent to the police. A resident of the area, Ibrahim Saidu, said the gunmen in their numbers went on rampage as they engaged both the police and some vigilantes in a shootout. Saidu said the gunmen, who first attacked residents of Anguwar Samu in Tungan-Maje, whisked away two persons after an exchange of gunfire that lasted over an hour. “The entire residents of Anguwar Samu were gripped with fear because of the gunshots but unfortunately, they succeeded in abducting two people,” he said. According to him, after the police were overpowered, the kidnappers proceeded to New Poultry area of the council where they also abducted two residents. He said the police officer and a vigilante who sustained injuries in the incident had been taken to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. The spokesperson for the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, neither responded to calls nor replied text messages when her reaction to the latest kidnap incident in the nation’s capital was sought. AGAIN, daredevil men on Monday abducted three women at Onipe community, near Idi Ayunre, Oluyole local government area of Oyo State. The gunmen emerged from the bush around 8:20a.m. and shot sporadically into the air before whisking the victims away. The victims were identified as Mrs Okeowo, Mrs Abosede Adebayo and Mrs Bola Ogunrinde. Ogunrinde was driving a Toyota RAV-4, with registration number AGL 66 FY. It would be recalled that three quarry site workers and a female commuter were kidnapped on the road some days ago. They regained their freedom last Friday. Two men (names withheld) had lodged a report on the kidnap incident at Idi Ayunre Police Division, which galvanised policemen into action.
The police operatives were joined by local hunters and vigilance group members in search for the victims and the abductors. Confirming the story, the president of Soludero Hunters Association of Nigeria, Oba Nureni Ajijola Anabi, said he and his men were awaiting directive from the Oyo State Government before they could go for search operation. “Yes, we heard and a security officer with the state government promised to get in touch with us but we have been trying to call him. We need to be mobilised. First, the thick forest where the kidnappers took their victims to is owned by the government. Also, we don’t have money we can spend.” Earlier on Sunday, 15 passengers travelling in a commercial vehicle with registration number KZR 345ZT, were abducted by heavily armed gunmen suspected to be bandits along the Tsakskiya-Ummadau road in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State. The incident, according to eyewitness, occurred around 3:00p.m. when the over 20 bandits ambushed the J5 bus conveying the victims returning from Jibia market. IN Rivers State, six persons were killed and scores others wounded as unknown gunmen invaded Uegwere community in Khana local government area of the state. The Guardian gathered that the assailants entered the community and opened fire on a group of youths going about their lawful duties. Former Chairman, Community Development Committee of the community, Gospower Ipianeh disclosed that the gunmen came in a commando style, went to a section of the community called Kako, and executed their deadly mission. The Chairman, Governing Council of Uegwere community, Mr. Chied Raphael Kponee, appealed to the government to come to their aid, saying learning has been disrupted. “We really want the government to come to our aid because if things continue this way, we will end up losing all members of our community. Everybody is scared and so we need the government to assist us. Already, some people have deserted the community. The few living there now are in fear because of what they witnessed. School did not open because of this incident,” he added. Chief Kponee said the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Bori Command came and saw the lifeless victims before they were buried. IN Ogun State, the state council of National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) has embarked on strike action over the kidnapping of its members and insecurity in the state. The strike took effect from midnight of April 13. In a statement by the chairman of NANNM, Roseline Solarin and the state NMA Chairman, Dr Oladayo Ogunlaja, and addressed to the Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Tomi Coker, the nurses condemned the lackadaisical attitude of the government towards the release of their colleagues. It described the recent kidnappings of health workers as “disheartening, repugnant and unacceptable.” It added that the state government’s approach of not negotiating with the kidnappers had made victims believe that their lives and property were of no essence to the government. It alleged that the state had not shown any commitment that could facilitate the early release of their members, hence, the decision to down tools. AS activities of kidnappers, bandits, ritualists, armed robbers, cultists, unknown gunmen and insurgents continue to be a thorn in the flesh of Nigerians, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) yesterday threw their weight behind the establishment of regional security outfits to provide cover for defenceless Nigerians suffering the brunt. However, they cautioned governors not to use regional security corps to oppress perceived enemies and gag voices of citizens that will lead to abuse of operations, but should allow them operate within the scope of the Act establishing them for professionalism and effective service to the people.
