Tonye Princewill Says Revalidation Is Last Chance To Have A Voice
Former Governorship candidate in Rivers and Chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Tonye Princewill, has described the allegation of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors on the inability of APC government to govern the country, as a mere distraction. The APC stalwart said PDP governors were fanning flames of division to wangle their way into the Villa, urging Nigerians not to be distracted but to observe the ongoing revalidation exercise to enable them choose good leaders in 2023. Recall that the PDP Governors’ Forum had warned that Nigeria was drifting into a brink of a failed state. The governors, who expressed deep concern on the deteriorating insecurity and relationship between the Federal Government and various groups in the country, spoke at a meeting in Markudi, Benue State on Friday. Speaking in Port Harcourt, yesterday, Princewill said: “Reacting to the latest outburst from the PDP Governors is a distraction. But there are some who may not be wise to their intentions, so let me do them a favour and bring them some light. If you are fooled into thinking that the statement was borne out of love for the country or patriotism, think again. It wasn’t. No group has done more to fan the flames of division than they have. They want to win the next election and this is the old formula they are using in a new time. Just watch them. “In 2023, they will present us with a President from amongst themselves from the North and use a divided country to try to wangle their way into the villa. Simple. I’d rather we concentrate on a party that is still evolving.” He said currently, several PDP officeholders and members are moving over to APC, stressing the need for Nigerians to observe the revalidation exercise, especially in Rivers State.
