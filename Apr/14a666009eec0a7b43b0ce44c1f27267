The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said religious bodies have an important role to play in a successful anti-graft fight. Its Executive Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, made the submission while opening a meeting of the Inter-faith Anti-Corruption Advisory Committee (IAAC) in Abuja. Represented by Director of Legal and Prosecution, Chile Okoroma, the nation’s chief crime-buster noted: “I believe strongly that as religious leaders and bodies, you have a critical and prominent role to play in the EFCC’s corruption prevention mandate.” He charged the committee to develop initiatives aimed at fighting sleaze in the two major religions – Christianity and Islam – stating that, “the fight must be from all fronts.” Bawa added: “I strongly believe that the corruption fight should not be left to the EFCC alone. All hands must be on deck and partnership within all critical stakeholders should be strengthened.” The event witnessed the formal handover between the outgone chairman, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede and his successor, Archbishop John Praise.
