Amid unrest in parts of Gombe State, including Biliri and Balanga local councils, the new monarch of Tangale, Mallam Sanusi Maiyamba, has sued for peace and total allegiance to the government. He explained to newsmen at the weekend the essence of his call for peaceful co-existence among the residents. “There can never be peace and the desired development in any state characterised by wanton killings and destruction. “We have never had it this good in Gombe until God visited and blessed us with Governor Muhammad Yahaya. What is left is just to embrace that the divine gift,” he said. The monarch particularly recalled that majority of Tangale people did not vote for the governor in 2019, yet the governor did not visit them with vengeance. His words: “Only 18,000 of our people voted for Governor Yahaya, yet rather than being discouraged, he has embarked on many abandoned road projects in Biliri. “The most I can do is to plead with my people in Biliri and the entire state to cooperate with him, so that we can enjoy more goodies of democracy. Imagine a governor that refused to be vengeful on us; rather he gave us two commissioners, chairmen and members of boards, Special Advisers (SAs) and Senior Special Advisers (SSAs).” Maiyamba urged his subjects to correct the mistake of 2019 in 2023 by trooping out to support the governor. He, however, appealed to warring groups in Biliri, Balanga and beyond to be calm. “Let’s join hands with the government to make Tangale and the entire state great. Without unity, there is no way the state can move forward,” he added. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
