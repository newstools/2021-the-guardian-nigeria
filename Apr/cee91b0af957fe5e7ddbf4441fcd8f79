Seventeen youths drawn from 17 local government councils in Enugu state have benefitted from the 2021 Youth Entrepreneurial and Leadership Initiative (YELI) N10 million project to enable them to finance their businesses. The YELI competition began in February to support youths between the ages of 20 and 35 years who have start-up businesses of not less than one year and not more than three years. At least, 900 youths took part in the competition in which 17 emerged finalists from the rigorous training. While each of the 17 finalists received N150,000 seed money, three others were awarded N2 million, N1 million and N500,000 among other business supports. Speaking at the event, a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, said entrepreneurship skills were what the youths required to overcome the unemployment crisis in the country. Nnamani stated that “the country was the way it is because a good number of persons known as politicians today do not have other means of sustenance” Hence, according to him, “they resort to looting and mismanagement of public resources in a bid to make money and in the end up in jail”. “So, you don’t aspire to get into politics when you don’t have a second address. This mentality of grabbing is the reason we are the way we are. This is something the youths must avoid to make the difference for our country to move forward,” he said.
