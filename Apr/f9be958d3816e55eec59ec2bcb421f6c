The strike embarked by Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has stalled hearing of the suit filed by some residents of Victory Park Estate, Lekki, against Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). The suit was scheduled to be heard on April 14, 2021 in the Lagos High Court, but could not go on as a result of the strike. In the suit, the residents accused AMCON of harassment over their property despite pending court cases and orders. They also accused AMCON and its receiver-manager of outright disregard for law and order and illegal use of official powers. The residents further claimed to have bought plots of land in the estate from Grant Properties Ltd; a company promoted by the late Rev Olajide Awosedo and his family, and obtained the relevant title documents. According to them, in 2003, Grant Properties and Knight Rook approached some of them individually and offered them plots in the estate, following which they invested their hard-earned money and life savings, while others obtained mortgage loans. The landlords under the aegis of the Association of Victory park Estate, Bare-land owners further urged the Federal and State governments and senior management of AMCON to stop the Receiver Manager, Mr. Lanre Olaoluwa from encroaching on their respective plots of land within the estate. They also urged the government to review the corporation’s conduct.
Speaking at a briefing last week, Mayowa Owolabi, a lawyer, representing some of the property owners in the estate, said that on September 2017, a certain Mr. Olaoluwa placed a signage on the perimeter fence around the Victory Park Estate indicating that AMCON was entitled to take possession of some plots of land within Victory Park Estate based on the orders of the Federal High Court made on the 16 of June 2016 in Suit No: FHC/AB/CS/69/2016- Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria v. Havilah Villas Limited & 10 Ors and Suit No: FHC/L/CS/744/2017- Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria v. Knight Rook Limited & 5 Ors. Owolabi alleged that AMCON is reselling the disputed properties and encouraging the buyers to start construction on the land. “To protect themselves from actions which would be inimical to the hearing of the suits, our members filed applications for orders of injunction to restrain AMCON and the other Defendants from alienating any of the plots or giving effect to any purported contract of sale or carrying out any construction work on the plots which are the subject matter of the suit. These injunctions have been granted in a number of the cases,” he said. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
