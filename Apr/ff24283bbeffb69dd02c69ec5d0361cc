The suspect, a resident of Oko Afor area of Badagry, Lagos State, was arrested while appearing as a counsel before Chief Magistrate B.I Ilo, at the chief magistratesâ€™ court, Agbara, Ogun State, on Wednesday. His presentation in court aroused the suspicion of the chief magistrate, who invited the police to arrest him for interrogation to authenticate his claim as a lawyer. Upon his arrest, the suspect was personally interrogated by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Agbara Division, SP Dahiru Saleh. He confessed that though he read law in the university, he had not been called to bar since he has not passed the law school examination. The commissioner of police, CP Edward Awolowo Ajogun, has ordered that the suspect be charged to court as soon as possible.
