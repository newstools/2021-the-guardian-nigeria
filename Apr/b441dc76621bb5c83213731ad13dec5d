The Nigerian hitman, who finished top scorer in the recently concluded 2020 AFCON qualification campaign with five goals, splashed out the cash on Mary Daniel, whose plight as a special person selling pure water on the streets came to the fore last week. In a country where even the able bodied ones are struggling for living in tough economic conditions, Mary Daniel has been facing a torrid time trying to make ends meet to support herself and her family. Moved by the difficult conditions of Mary Daniel, Osimhen swiftly swung into action by sending his friends to check on Mary Daniel before transferring an undisclosed amount of cash to her. Speaking after receiving the cash gift, an ecstatic Mary Daniel burst into tears of joy to appreciate Victor Osimhen for providing succor to her at such critical point in time. “I thank you for this great show of love and kindness to me and pray that God will continue to uplift you in your soccer career as you have deemed it necessary to support a special person like me,” Mary Daniel said. Osimhen is coming to the rescue of pure water sellers in Nigeria as he once sold the item at age six following the death of his mother.
His gift to Mary Daniel gained social media relevance when celebrity instagram influencer, Tunde Ednot, posted the story on his page. Ednot’s post on Victor Osimhen’s donation to Mary Daniel went viral, attracting thousands of positive comments for the Napoli striker, who also thanked Ednot for highlighting his contribution to humanity. A top football licensed agent, Drew Uyi commended Osimhen for giving to a less privileged physically-challenged person. He said: “For an athlete or footballer’s brand to grow, he or she has to give back, financial, service, time or otherwise. Victor Osimhen has done well.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
