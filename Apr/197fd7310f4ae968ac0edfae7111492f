The National President, Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Iju Tony Nwabunike, has charged maritime stakeholders, especially importers and freight forwarders, to be law-abiding in their dealings at the ports to boost the nation’s economic growth.
   
He enjoined importers and freight forwarders to make sincere declarations of goods and pay taxes in form of import duties, as ways of reducing rising unemployment and contribute to national development.  “Many are active but not productively engaged due to possible factors such as greed, causing fewer persons to appropriate common wealth, while active workers are mostly underpaid. Let’s make sacrifices for common good, be forgiving, avoid greed, run away from acts of betrayal and shun lust for earthly wealth at the detriment of the common good.”
 
Nwabunike also called for mutual love, forgiveness, and sincerity among maritime stakeholders, saying it is time to resolve all differences, just as he has forgiven those who had hurt him in the past. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
