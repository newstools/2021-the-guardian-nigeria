President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State have been called to immediately intervene in renewed attacks in the southern part of the state. The Kente Development Association (KDA), in a statement yesterday, also tasked security agencies to do everything humanly possible to fish out and prosecute those behind the daily killings, which had been preventing them from going to their farmlands. Signed by the chairman, Fred Agbu, and secretary, Job Hosea, the statement also beckoned Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State and Tiv leaders to tell the attackers, who they suspect to be Tiv, to put down their weapons and embrace peace. The associates, who drew the attention of Buhari, Ishaku, and Ortom to the killings in Kente community of Wukari Council and other villages, said the sole aim behind the attacks was to debar the people from engaging in farming. “The singular aim of the current renewed attacks and hostilities on Kente is to prevent our teeming population of farmers from farming activities. We have confirmed that the Tiv people have vowed not to allow the Jukun people in Kente, Rafin-Kada, Chonku, Tsokundi, and Akwana wards of Wukari to engage in farming activities during this rainy and cropping season.” At press time, some roads leading in and out of the areas were not passable following the daily activities of the hoodlums.
