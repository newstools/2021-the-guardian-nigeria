A new episode of the Team Qhubeka (www.TeamQhubeka.com) podcast – Unclipped – is out now featuring our Austrian rider, Michael Gogl.  The episode explores various aspects of his life including his role as a road captain, his approach to nutrition, and why cycling won out ahead of a potential career as a celloist! The 27-year-old, dubbed by some in the media as the “Austrian interloper” –  following his exploits at a memorable 2021 Strade Bianche – also gives his insights on a special day of racing while also providing a fascinating insight into the key role he played in the past for Alberto Contador and how he’s now looking at taking the next step in his own career. ‘Unclipped with Team Qhubeka ASSOS’ is available via all podcasting platforms including: Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Team Qhubeka ASSOS.

Team Qhubeka ASSOS is a purpose-led, high-performance team, fighting to win on the world's biggest stage, to inspire hope and create opportunity. Founded in 2007, Team Qhubeka ASSOS (formerly NTT Pro Cycling) became the first-ever African cycling team to gain a UCI WorldTour license, in 2016. We achieved our first major win in 2013 when Gerald Ciolek won Milan-San Remo, one of the five Monuments of cycling. We have competed in six Tour de France’s and notched up 7 stage wins, with Mark Cavendish wearing the coveted Yellow Jersey at the 2016 Tour de France. We are a multicultural, diverse team with bases in South Africa, the Netherlands and Italy. There are 19 nationalities represented across our World Tour and continental feeder team rosters. Our focus on developing African cycling has resulted in more than 55 riders from the African continent be given the opportunity to race on the world stage, since the team's inception. We race to help people to move forward with bicycles through our relationship with Qhubeka Charity. Through our work with Qhubeka, we have contributed to the distribution of over 30 000 bicycles in communities in South Africa. About Qhubeka:
Qhubeka is a charity that moves people forward with bicycles. People earn bicycles through our programmes, improving their access to schools, clinics and jobs. A bicycle is a tool that helps people to travel faster and further, and to carry more. In the face of extreme and persistent poverty, bicycles can change lives by helping to address socioeconomic challenges at the most basic level – helping people to get where they need to go.
