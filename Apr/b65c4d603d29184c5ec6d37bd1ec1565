Some yet-to-be identified people have again attempted to attack Chief Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a. Igboho), a Yoruba freedom fighter at his Soka residence, Ibadan, in Oyo State. The intruders, according to his spokespersons, Mr. Koiki Olayomi and Dapo Salami, confirmed that the attackers stormed the house around 1:30 a.m. and attempted to set it ablaze but were resisted by the vigilant security aides of Igboho. Koiki, on his Facebook page, said the gunmen invaded the home of Sunday Igboho located at Soka area of Ibadan in the early hours of Monday. He alleged that the residence was besieged by men of the Nigerian Army with the aim of arresting the activist. Koiki said: “There is a situation right now where the Federal Government of Nigeria tried to invade. We are telling the world that the war that the Federal Government is waiting for might start today. “The war that the Federal Government think they are expecting from the Yoruba people; let’s tell the whole world. As I speak with you, there is an ongoing incident but we are more than capable. “Right now, I am telling the Yoruba people across the South-West that we would shut down the South-West today. “The whole South-West will go on a total shut down today. We are capable enough to tell the Federal Government that those they are fomenting trouble with are not #EndSARS agitators and today will be the beginning of the problem that the Federal Government of Nigeria is waiting for. “We are not going to take it easy and we will deal with them; those whom they sent. “Federal Government does not know who they were dealing with. Let the state know. My name is Olayomi Koiki. Chief Sunday Igboho is fine. You cannot threaten us.” Meanwhile, facts behind the reported attack could not be confirmed as the police were yet to release an official statement on it.
