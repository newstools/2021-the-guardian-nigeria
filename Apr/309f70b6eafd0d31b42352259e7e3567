This came as the company announced its partnership with the Ogun State Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OGUNCCIMA) for the 10th Gateway International Trade Fair 2021, themed “Remodelling Agriculture, Commerce and Trade beyond Nigerian Borders with Modern Technology”, which holds in Abeokuta from April 2 and 12 Group Chief Branding and Communication, Anthony Chiejina, in a statement, said the group had concluded plans to scale up investments in the agricultural sector, in response to the focus of the Federal Government. He said the fertiliser plant the company is constructing at Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, will be commissioned soon as part of its commitment to agricultural revival. Chiejina explained that all the subsidiaries of the company would be at the trade fair and urged members of the public to take advantage of this year’s edition to strike a partnership with the group. According to him, the group has also kick-started the development of six large-scale rice milling plants in six states – Kano, Jigawa, Zamfara, Niger, Kebbi, and Sokoto – with a combined milling capacity of 1.5 million per annum. He said Dangote’s growing investment in the agricultural sector was to complement the existing and continuing investments in other sectors such as cement, salt, and other consumer products. “We are also significantly involved in the oil and gas sector, with the ongoing construction of one of the world`s largest petroleum refineries. This will not only put an end to the embarrassing importation of products into our crude oil-rich country but will also significantly boost our intra-African trade position,” he said.
