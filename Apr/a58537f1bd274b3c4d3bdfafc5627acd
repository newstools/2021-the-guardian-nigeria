Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit popularly called ‘Task Force,’ yesterday, impounded 81 motorcycles for plying restricted routes in the state. The 81 motorcycles were impounded at Jakande Estate, Isolo, for endangering the lives of other road users. The chairman, Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit, CSP Shola Jejeloye, who led the operation, stated that the seizure was in line with enforcement of the Lagos State Traffic Law and to halt the flagrant abuse of traffic laws by the motorcyclists. He noted that government was concerned about the recklessness of motorcyclists on restricted routes, and therefore became necessary to help the motorcyclists by saving their own lives and those of other road users. He pointed out that the government would not allow motorcyclists to create chaos for other road users on prohibited routes, adding that it had become crucial for the government to prevent an increase in the trend of crime perpetrated by motorcyclists in the metropolis, particularly in prohibited routes. Jejeloye restated the agency’s commitment to continue the clamp down on recalcitrant motorcyclists plying restricted routes, adding that the move would help safeguard the security of lives and property. The chairman called for the co-operation of Lagosians by desisting from boarding motorcycles in prohibited areas, emphasising that the state traffic law is for the overall interest of the society.
