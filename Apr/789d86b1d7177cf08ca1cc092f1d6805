• Backs Ebube Agu, ESN synergy A DIASPORA Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly (IWA), has berated the Federal Government for labeling the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist organisation. The group also canvassed for synergy between the South-East and South-West, saying that because the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Chief Obafemi Awolowo could not forge a common front during the First Republic does not mean Yoruba and Igbo cannot work as one today. In a statement, yesterday, IWA Chairman, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Secretary-General, Oliver Nwankor, said it was unfortunate that the same administration, which turned its deaf ear to the atrocities of killer herdsmen, “who are the real killers, kidnappers and rapists” across the country, is branding IPOB, a group agitating for self-determination and proper restructuring of the country, a ‘terrorist group’. IWA, while also throwing its weight behind the South-East new security outfit, urged all Igbo town unions, vigilantes, including the new security outfit, Ebube Agu and Eastern Security Network (ESN), to work together for the security of the Igbo communities.” The statement read: “The armed herdsmen terrorists, who are the real threat to peace and unity of Nigeria are treated with kid’s gloves by the government while turning around to hound IPOB members who, as far as we are concerned, are not terrorists, but are freedom fighters agitating for a better deal for their people.” IWA said that all Igbo communities should set up vigorous and robust vigilante outfits to guard every part of the state, saying: “We support civil defence in every part of Igboland in anticipation of nefarious activities in their respective areas of concerns. Igbo people must apply old school diplomacy that is deep-rooted in synergy and flexibility, collaboration and dialogue. It is time for diversification of strategies that would allow room for multiple options at all times.” “We should always put our smartest men and women that are skilled in diplomacy at the helm of Igbo affairs. These men and women must be ready and willing to genuinely represent Igbo interest at the centre, Nigerian and Worldwide.” Besides, IWA said that the Igbo nation needs a wealth of knowledge in understanding of diplomacy and alliance building for the people of the South-East to form coalitions and alliances with the people of the South-West, South-South, Middle Belt regions and others, stressing: “Because the great Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Chief Obafemi Awolowo alliance did not work out well in the past does not mean that the Igbo and the Yoruba cannot achieve this alliance today. We need each other to survive in our journey to justice.  In politics, there is no permanent enemies or permanent friends, only permanent interests.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
