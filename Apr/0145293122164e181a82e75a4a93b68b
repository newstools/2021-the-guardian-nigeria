 [FILES] Samuel Ortom. Photo: IREPORTERS  Ortom, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, yesterday, described the attack as mindless and wondered why a harmless priest would become the target of armed men. He reassured the people of Katsina-Ala and Sankera that his government would not relent until those responsible for the killing and other attacks in that part of the state were brought to justice. The governor reaffirmed the resolve of his administration not to hand over the state to criminals and urged Benue people to continue to support security operatives with useful information. Ortom sympathised with the bereaved families and prayed to God to grant the soul of the cleric eternal rest.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
