The House of Representatives has resolved to check flaring gas in Nigeria. This followed a motion yesterday by Abdulahi Ibrahim Halims, who decried its ripple effects on the nation’s economy He noted that the most populous nation had moved against the unfriendly act with a law gazetted as “Prevention of Waste and Pollution- Regulations 2018”. The lawmaker said gas flare tracker via satellite had been welcomed by the petroleum industry globally, regretting that it is only in Nigeria that discrepancies exist between the flared volume reported by the satellite and government. BESIDES, the Green Chamber has ordered an immediate probe into illicit trade in human parts in the country. The resolution followed the seizure of a cargo in Nigeria with 7,200 refrigerated penises, in 36 boxes labelled as plantain on the ship that harboured at the Shanghai Port, popularly called Red Market. Adopting the motion jointly sponsored by Rimamnde Shawulu Kwewum and Olajide Olatubosun at the plenary presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Idris, the House mandated its Committees on Human Rights and National Security and Intelligence to investigate the entire gamut of the trade and report back within 10 weeks for further legislative action. Kwewum (PDP: Taraba), while moving the motion, warned that if nothing is done to curb the unholy act, more criminals would set up shops in human organs in Nigeria, taking advantage of the insecurity in the country. The lawmaker argued that the increased banditry, kidnappings and violence in parts of the federation make those areas vulnerable and ready haven for the hoodlums.
