Yuguda said the recent sukuk bonds issued by the Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO), which were all oversubscribed, emphasise the need to enhance SEC’s regulatory capacity, adding that the sovereign bonds set the benchmark for other entities to issue sukuk for various developmental activities.  
  
According to him, the SEC’s quest for in-depth knowledge in non-interest capital market products, operations and services is underscored by the recent increase in market activities such as the entrance of more assets managers, investment advisers, real estate investment trusts and advisory experts to provide new asset classes for Nigerian investors.  “Today, therefore, is a landmark day for all of us logged in to this training? As we kick start the programme, I urge all participants to participate fully and leverage this golden opportunity to learn from the experts and cross-fertilize ideas, as capacity building is fundamental to enabling this sector” he added.
