Gunmen on Thursday night killed six persons in Wereng village of Riyom Local Council of Plateau State. 
 
The attack, which took place about 10:30pm, also left two others severely injured.
 
Chairman of Riyom Local Government, Mafeng Gwalson, confirmed the attack to journalists in Jos, yesterday.
 
In his reaction, Senator Istifanus Gyang, representing Plateau North senatorial district, unequivocally condemned the “unwarranted attack on peace-loving and hardworking citizens.” In a press statement by his spokesperson, Musa Ashoms, the senator said killers are not unknown to security agencies, adding: “It is sad, therefore, that people in Plateau North are repeatedly being hunted, ambushed and killed without any decisive action.”  Those people killed and injured were miners returning home, who had stopped to take a short rest when the gunmen appeared and opened fire on them. They include Chung William, Bulus Dabon, Peter William, Dung Gyang, Dachung Gara and Davou Dachung. The two injured are Davou Jatau and Gyang Jatau. Last week, eight people were also killed in the same local council by yet to be identified gunmen.  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
