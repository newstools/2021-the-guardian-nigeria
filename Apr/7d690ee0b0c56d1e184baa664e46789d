I am so excited.” Meanwhile, stakeholders in volleyball have applauded the Nigeria Volleyball Federation President, Musa Nimrod, over his giant contributions to the game. The volleyball boss yesterday presented 111 volleyball balls to all the 36 states, including FCT, at the ongoing festival. Each state went home with three match balls. He also presented nets to all states in South West, South East, North Central, and South-South. This is coming a few months after the North East and North West region got their own nets. Speaking after receiving the equipment on behalf of other states’ sports directors, Kaduna Director of Sports, Yakub Ibrahim, described the gesture as a great motivation for players in the country. In his remarks, Nimrod urged states to organise more volleyball programmes in their states. Also speaking on the gesture, Vincent Onogu, a renowned volleyball grassroots coach, said: “For the first time, our young players will have the opportunity to play with FIVB specified match balls.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
