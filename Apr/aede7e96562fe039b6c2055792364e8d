Nigerian Stock Exchange Gains recorded by many blue-chip stocks, especially First City Monument Bank (FCMB) and Northern Nigeria Flour Mills (NNFM), aided transactions on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) yesterday, causing market capitalisation to appreciate by N21 billion.

Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value rose by N21 billion to close at N20.331 trillion. The upturn was also driven by price appreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks amongst such as UAC of Nigeria (UACN), NNFM, Guaranty Trust Bank, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) and FCMB Group. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing & Brokerage: “Barring another large cross on any of the large-caps in tomorrow’s session, we expect trading to be mixed with a slightly positive tilt. We note the possibility of some investors taking profit on the recent gains and do not rule out a slight sell-off on the banking names ahead of further earnings releases.” On the price movement chart, 18 stocks appreciated while 12 constituted the losers’ chart.
