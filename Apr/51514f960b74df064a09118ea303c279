 Diouf during the signing-up ceremony of Dr Jibunoh in Lagos.  Jibunoh stated this recently when CFAO Motors endorsed him as the Suzuki brand ambassador in Nigeria. However, he said there is little that could be done without the right policies in place and the will to implement them. In his words: “I recently read that just about two per cent of the population could afford to buy a new car. A lot of our cars are old and badly maintained; this is bad for the environment. I am however encouraged that Suzuki has established partnerships with leading Nigerian banks to provide suitable financing offers.” Interestingly, this is not the first time the ‘The Desert Warrior’ is chosen to be a Suzuki brand ambassador. Responding to questions from journalists shortly after the deal about his new role, the one-time chairman of Costain West Africa Plc. said that his affectionate relationship and emotional attachment with Suzuki spans over 30 years. Jibunoh also disclosed that his new role is an opportunity to share his desert stories with Suzuki and the many things that can be done for the environment with this platform. On what informed the decision to sign the ambassador, General Manager of Suzuki by CFAO Motors, Aissatou Diouf, said the Suzuki franchise was excited by Jibunoh’s exploits following his crossing the desert three times with Suzuki vehicles. Diouf said it was a smart decision because he is a reputable Nigerian, who is fighting for a noble cause and we are glad that Suzuki is part of his story.
