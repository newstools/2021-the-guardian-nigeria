Regé-Jean Page | Image: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX Regé-Jean Page, who portrayed the dashing Duke of Hastings in Season 1 of Bridgerton, will not return for the second season of the hit Netflix series. On the show’s Instagram and Twitter pages, a letter penned by Lady Whistledown confirmed on Friday that the Netflix hit will move on to season 2 without Page, who played Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings. “Dear Readers, while all eyes turn to Lord Anthony Bridgerton’s quest to find a Viscountess, we bid adieu to Regé-Jean Page, who so triumphantly played the Duke of Hastings,” the message began. “We’ll miss Simon’s presence onscreen, but he will always be a part of the Bridgerton family,” it continued. “Daphne will remain a devoted wife and sister, helping her brother navigate the upcoming social season and what it has to offer – more intrigue and romance than my readers may be able to bear.”   A post shared by Bridgerton (@bridgertonnetflix)  Page, 31, addressed the news on Instagram with a photo of himself on horseback as the Duke. “The ride of a life time,” the British-Zimbabwean star wrote. “It’s been an absolute pleasure and a privilege to be your Duke. Joining this family — not just on screen, but off screen too. Our incredibly creative and generous cast, crew, outstanding fans — it’s all been beyond anything I could have imagined. The love is real and will just keep growing.”   A post shared by Regé-Jean Page (@regejean)  Bridgerton premiered on Netflix on December 25, 2020.
