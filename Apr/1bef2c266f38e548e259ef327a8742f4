A 38-year old Kelfari Jediel at the weekend stabbed his 20-year old cousin, Parambiu Alexander, to death over N150. The family members hail from Fotta community in Gombi Local Government Area of Adamawa State. Kelfari, a father of two murdered Parambiu during unresolved fisticuffs over a N150 balance after sharing of money they both realised from a job jointly executed in the area, findings by The Guardian revealed. “We were engaged in a successful plaster job on April 14, this year, after which we were paid money, after sharing it, there was a balance of N150 which I supposed to give Alex but I didn’t because I am his elder,” Kelfari said. The accused said the deceased insisted on having it, “in the process, we started dragging ourselves all over the premises. “At a point, a neighbor heard our counter-accusations over the balance and decided to intervene,” Kelfari said. “She came to us and gave Alex N150 for peace to reign but when the woman left, Alex again resumed his initial demands saying the N150 the woman gave him was a gift, not the balance. “I went in to inform his mother who advised that I should seek Police intervention. “As I was coming out, Alex accosted me insisting on having the N150 balance. “There and then we started fighting. He pinned me to the ground and held my neck, when I couldn’t bear the choke anymore, l drew out a knife from my waist and stabbed him on the chest,” Kelfari said shedding tears. He said Parambiu died on the way to the health center in Fotta, after which he was apprehended by the police.
