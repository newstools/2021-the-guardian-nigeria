The objective of basic principles of natural law is an essential requirement when criticizing unjust situation and unacceptable conducts in a given society irrespective of conflicting opinions. The tenets of traditional African culture and religion conform with the two major religious beliefs in Nigeria: Christianity and Islam, in other words, immorality is alien to our society.  Morals apply to a broad field of conducts evaluated in terms of its aims, ends or results, while morality refers to a body of conducts according to accepted standards. Morality is an embodiment of approved customs, cultures or habits of a society of which an individual is a member. I wish to start by saying, and, it is a statement of fact, that the social media era is an interesting time in human history.
 
The advent of social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and the likes, has made life a lot easier. These platforms now offer faster, easier and convenient ways of accessing, receiving and disseminating information. Consequently, governments, institutions, corporate organisations, Non Governmental Organizations, NGOs, academic institutions and business concerns as well as individuals have found social media as avenues of reaching their countrymen and target audiences. The speed, convenience and multiple reach advantages of social media remain unquantifiable value addition to the users. 
 
The social media driven-economy is phenomenal and unprecedented. Millions of people now advertise and run their businesses, products and services on social media platforms. The stress-less income flow and patronage network with limitless opportunities have aggregated social media to become an epitome of new normal in business and economic activities globally.  On the other hand, section 6, 17, 18 and 32 of the National Information Technology Development Agency Act LFN 2007 empowers the agency to issue regulations, framework and guideline for the use of information technology in Nigeria which includes the social media.
 
This contribution is not to support or promote the gagging of social media or to preach against creative minds and comedy works being promoted on the various platforms, but to lay credence to Section 36(1) (a) and (b) 36(2) (a) to (c) of the NFVCB Act which states that any publication, videos, pictures that depicts explicit sexual activities or acts designed to encourage homosexuality or contravenes moral values in Nigeria should be at least censored.
 
Corporate bodies that contravene the law are already taken care of in section 61 of the NFVCB and 17 of NITDA Act. The Board may through the big brands (social media accounts) and business owners limit who and what they can publish or promote and by so doing regulate, promote educational, moral contents and values.
 
This is the time to save and restore African values, ethics, morals and cultures which the younger generation and the generations to come may inherit before they are totally discarded. It is also highly recommended for relevant government agencies to initiate regulations and prosecution of the promoters of homosexuality and transgender agents as a means of deterrence and enforcement of law and order, as they only corrupt public morals.
