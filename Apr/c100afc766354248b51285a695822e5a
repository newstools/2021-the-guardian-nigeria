It was also learned that some criminals among the inmates instigated others to protest against the service having heard of the incidents at Oko, Benin, and Owerri centres to effect jailbreaks for possible escape. The development led to violence, damaging of cells, admin block, medical office, and drilling of holes on the perimeter fence in a bid to facilitate their escape. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the service, Aminu Suleiman, confirmed the incident. He said the inmates were repelled due to the re-enforcement of security operatives deployed to the centre to ensure normalcy and control of the situation. “The situation is under control and the inmates have returned to their cells. No life was lost, but some staff and inmates sustained various degrees of injuries and no inmate escaped from custody,” he said. Suleiman added that the state Controller, Felix Lawrence, who visited the centre on the heels of the incident, commended sister security agencies for the effective synergy and prompt response. He, therefore, assured members of the general public of peace and calm at the various custodial centres in the state.
