Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday, berated banks for over-charging customers during transactions. Besides those known ones, he pointed out that there were other ‘hidden’ fees the financial institutions imposed on their clients. Gbajabiamila said such actions were rendering Nigerians helpless, calling on the banks to come up with ways to address the high levies on loans and other services they offer. He spoke when he hosted the board and management of Standard Chartered Bank, led by the Chief Executive Officer, Lamin Manjang, in Abuja. The nation’s number four citizen also deplored the exploitative marketing some marketers are subjected to, inquiring if that was the practice globally.
