The two victims were taken into the hospital for treatment after the shooting. The man died from his wounds. The injured woman works as a security guard at the hospital, which runs a Covid-19 vaccination centre. There was no immediate indication as to the attacker’s motive. Police cordoned off the area around the hospital, AFP journalists said. A fire engine and several police vans lined the street outside the facility. The hospital is situated close to the river Seine about four kilometres (2.5 miles) south of the Eiffel Tower and near the Parc des Princes football stadium.
