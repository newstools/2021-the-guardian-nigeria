Nigeria is losing huge revenue as bandits infiltrate mining sites causing investors to flee the sector. Experts have warned that if the criminalities continue unabated, the global mining industry would avoid Nigeria’s mineral resources, as it was in the case of Sierra Leone and Liberia, among other African countries.
   
The Guardian learnt that the activities of criminals in the sector have stopped exploration and exploitation of gold in Zamfara State; Lead-Zinc mining in Zurak, Taraba State; exploration activities in Southern Kaduna restricted due to frequent kidnappings and exploration and small scale mining in Igangan, Oyo state, infiltrated by herdsmen.
