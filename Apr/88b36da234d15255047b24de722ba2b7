If it were by skills or ability, all the songs I write will live in my songbook for ages and no one will know or hear about them. I once read and digested a book titled Uncover Your Potentials by the late Dr. Myles Munroe and the rest is history.” She described her style of music as sentimental, sending positive messages to the listener and spiritual elevation to the next level. “Every song I am inspired to write comes with its own unique sound and message,” she said. Sharing her view on how the Internet has impacted the music business, the mentor and coach on Prepmajor, an IT based training platform said the internet has promoted the exposure of music talents, adding that it removed barriers, as people can showcase their talents independently.
