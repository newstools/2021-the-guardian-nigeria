“For me, it’s all about the difference,” says young Emmanuel George. With his discography, the Port Harcourt-based Christian Gospel singer, popular as Emmy G, is out to rebel against the norm, hoping to cause a paradigm shift in the perception of Gospel music in the country.
  
“I choose to defy the norm; I’m trying to redefine the sound called Gospel music. My kind of Gospel music is different. We have this idea of what Gospel music is all about – the normal ‘Churchy’ vibes. You could pick a Gospel sound from just the intro, but with most of the songs on my album you would have to check out the lyrics before you realize it is a Gospel album,” he says boldly.
  
The Bayelsa native stretches this ambition further with his debut studio album, titled Cross and Disciple, which is soon to be released under his label, Diadem Multimedia International (DMI). 
  
Produced during the COVID-19 triggered lockdown, by sound experts Dami Ayeni of DMI and Scarlet sounds, the eight-track sound piece bares a melange of Afro-fusion sounds, from highlife to Afro Pop, to RnB and a myriad of genre-bending sounds, creating a unique sound direction that is unlike mainstream Gospel records. The songs reflect Christian and moral messages on spiritual connectivity, life struggles, among others.
