Italy midfielder Verratti, 28, will also miss PSG’s top-of-the-table clash with Lille on Saturday, with the teams in first and second place and locked on 63 points. This is the second time this year that Verratti has contracted Covid-19. He missed two Ligue 1 matches between the end of January and the start of February due to a positive virus test. His absence will make the task harder for PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino as his will also be without Verratti’s midfield partner Leandro Paredes. Bayern will be without star striker Robert Lewandowski for Wednesday’s match at the Allianz Arena after the Pole was ruled out for nearly a month with a knee injury picked up on international duty.
