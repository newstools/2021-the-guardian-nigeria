The downturn was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks including MTN Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria, Chemical & Allied Products, Julius Berger Nigeria and NCR Nigeria. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “We are not optimistic of significant gains in the market this week as investor sentiment remains sub-par.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was negative, as 18 stocks depreciated while 15 constituted the gainers’ list. Japaul Gold and Ventures recorded the highest price gain of 8.70 per cent to close at 75 kobo, per share.

Meanwhile, the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc, yesterday announced the launch of its new corporate brand identity and website. The launch of the new identity follows the demutualisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and the resulting creation of the non-operating holding company NGX Group Plc and its subsidiaries. The NGX brand identity follows a monolithic brand architecture, which will facilitate the formation of any new subsidiary by leveraging existing brand equity. The identity is inspired by the arrows of the stock exchange ticker tape as well as monetary exchange between a buyer and seller. These arrows are stylised to form an ‘N’ and denote the act of collaboration. Speaking on the development, the Group Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Oscar N. Onyema, stated, “We are very excited about the launch of our new brand identity and website at this pivotal time in our history. Influenced by the dynamism and resilience of our market in both good and challenging times, our new identity, which builds on our rich heritage, reflects who we are today, our ambitions for the future, and our resolve to deliver superior value to our stakeholders. As we step into the NGX era, we remain committed to achieving the highest level of competitiveness, both in African and global capital markets.
