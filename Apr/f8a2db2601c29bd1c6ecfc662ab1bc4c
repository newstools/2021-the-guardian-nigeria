We have restaurants and we cater to the oil and gas industry, we are in the hospitality business but it is taking us a bit of time to come back into Lagos”. He added that “we are also into cinemas. In Lagos, most people know us for our cinemas but we do more catering and restaurants than cinemas. So, we thought it was time to bring the restaurants back into Lagos. We have restaurants in Enugu, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Owerri. “This is food-on-the-go. It’s a quick-service restaurant. We had world winning international interior designer from South Africa called Dakota design the interior. So, you have a lovely ambience paired with affordable food.
