Tension has enveloped Koka community in Obokun Local Council of Osun State as some gunmen, suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, invaded the neighbourhood at night. The AK-47 wielding men of the underworld were said to have attacked the residents of the community, which shares boundaries with the Osun State University, Osogbo campus, and ordered them to come out of their various houses. A resident of the community, who craved anonymity, told The Guardian that the gunmen were Fulani herdsmen and that they stormed their community around 11:00 p.m. on Sunday. The source said that immediately the gunmen, numbering eight, arrived, they ordered the residents to march out of their houses and led them towards the bush in the locality. It was gathered that while the residents were being taken to the bush, one of them veered off the line unknown to the gunmen and put a telephone call to the hunters’ group in the state. The hunters, on receiving the distress call, were said to have arrived at the village and foiled the kidnap attempt. The gunmen were said to have angrily shot three of the residents during a gun duel between them, the hunters and some locals. Besides, The Guardian learnt that the hunters had got a tip-off that some gunmen were going to strike in Osogbo and had mounted surveillance around the capital city before the distress call came to them. MEANWHILE, the police have confirmed the attempted abduction of the villagers, adding that three residents of the community and hunters sustained bullet wounds during the attack. The Osun State Police Command’s Spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, yesterday, said that some hunters and villagers mobilised themselves and engaged the suspected Fulani herdsmen in gun-duel. “Some hoodlums, suspected to be herdsmen, attacked Koka Village in Obokun Local Council and attempted to abduct some villagers. Consequently, villagers and hunters mobilised and engaged the hoodlums in a fight and liberated themselves. “Three villagers and hunters sustained bullet wounds during the rescue operation. The victims are responding to treatment at Asubiaro State Hospital in Osogbo. Police drafted officers to join the locals in search of the fleeing gunmen,” Opalola said. Leader of the hunters’ group in the state, Mr. A. K. Odetode, who also confirmed the attempted kidnap and shooting of residents, said some bullet shell casings found at the scene of the attack had been handed over to the police.
