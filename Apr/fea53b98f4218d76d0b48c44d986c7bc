Joeboy has finally released “Door” in collaboration with Kwesi Arthur; from the Inception Into Stardom (2017). Nigerian recording artist Joeboy, has distinguished himself as indeed neat and a minister of good vibes and positivity.  The visuals to this song, clearly depict and illustrate Joeboy’s desire and zeal to win back her lover. The set is done using the traditional and mostly dramatic Nigerian home set up with the parental and teenage roles clearly set out. It builds up just as the song does with a new vixen scene change to match his love for her and closes down later Joeboy opening this heavenly door to her heart of which he has really sought. The release of “Door” marks the beginning of more milestones for Joeboy since his last album ‘Somewhere Between Beauty & Magic’ by Banku Music and emPawa Africa; released in February. This topped charts including a No. 1 holder on Apple Music in 28 countries and with over 114 million streams across distributing platforms. Listen to 3 top trending Joeboy songs on Mdundo Charts.
